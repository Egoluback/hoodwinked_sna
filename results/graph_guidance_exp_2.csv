I'm not pointing fingers at anyone, but I do think it's suspicious that we had a chance to search the shower and bathroom twice without finding any clues or the key. It makes me wonder if our killer is someone who's been playing it too safe or if they're just really good at blending in. I'm not sure, but I think we should keep a close eye on everyone, especially those who haven't been in the bathroom yet.""""
Tim: """"I think we can all agree that the killer's strategy has been to keep us separated and give them an opportunity to slip in and out unnoticed. Considering we didn't find any obvious clues in the bathroom or shower, it's possible our killer might be someone who's been working closely with someone else to create an alibi. I'd like to ask Regan and Bob, can you both confirm that you were together in the kitchen when I found the key, and have you both been together since then?""""
Bob: """"I've been thinking, and I've noticed that we've all been pretty focused on the bathroom and shower, but we didn't actually check the kitchen thoroughly. I remember seeing some faint scratches on the counter when I was getting a glass of water earlier. It's not much, but it could be something.

We should ask him about his whereabouts during that time.""""
Tim: """"Guys, I think Regan has a point, and I'd like to clear the air. I was in the Bathroom, but I didn't see or hear anything out of the ordinary. I was just washing my hands. But I did notice that Bob was arguing with Regan earlier in the day, and it seemed pretty intense. I don't know if that's relevant, but it's something that stood out to me. As for motives, I have to admit that I wasn't a fan of Bob's, but I don't think I had any reason to want him dead. What about you guys? Do you have any alibis or motives you'd like to share?""""

Bryce: """"I'm getting a bit tired of everyone pointing fingers at me. I think it's time we focus on the facts. Regan was the one who first mentioned that I was in the Hallway when we heard the commotion, which I already explained was just me taking a closer look. And as for motives, I don't think anyone can seriously say they were innocent towards Bob. Tim, you brought up your own dislike for Bob, and I'm pretty sure Regan had her issues with him too. I think we should be careful not to let our personal feelings cloud our judgment. Let's keep an eye on each other, but I think it's time we stopped accusing each other and started looking for actual clues.""""
Regan: """"I agree with Bryce that we need to focus on the facts, but I still think there's something off about his alibi. He's been acting pretty suspiciously, and his sudden defense is starting to raise some red flags for me. I'd like to ask Tim if he remembers anything else about Sally's death, maybe something that could help us piece together what happened. And Tim, I have to ask, did you have any issues with Sally that might have led you to want her dead?""""
Tim: """"Hey, I understand where Regan is coming from, but let's not jump to conclusions about me either. As for Sally, I did have some issues with her, but I think we can both agree that she was a bit of a drama queen. I had no reason to kill her, though. I was actually with Regan in the Living Room when we heard the commotion, so I think we should focus on finding actual evidence rather than just assuming people are guilty based on their past disagreements. And I think it's worth mentioning that I didn't see or hear anything that would suggest someone was following Sally or trying to harm her. Maybe we should look into the events leading up to her death, like who was with her last and what she was doing before the murder?""""

I've noticed Regan has been asking a lot of questions about the layout of the house and the security system. It's possible she's planning something, but it could also be a genuine concern for her own safety. We should definitely keep an eye on her, but let's also consider the possibility that Bryce's death might be connected to something external, like a break-in or an intruder.""""

Let's keep investigating, ask more questions, and try to find some concrete evidence before making any accusations.

Lena: """"I think Sally has a good point about my vote to banish Regan, and I can see how it might seem suspicious. However, I genuinely believed Regan was the most likely suspect at the time, and I was trying to eliminate her from the group. But now that she's dead, I do think we should re-examine the situation and consider alternative theories. I'm not convinced that Sally is correct about me, but I do think we should be careful not to jump to conclusions about each other. Perhaps we should focus on finding more concrete evidence and clues to uncover the truth.""""
Bob: """"I think both Sally and Lena have valid points, and I'm not sure who to believe at this point. But I do think we need to re-examine our previous conversations and votes. Sally mentioned my calm demeanor, but I think Lena's vote to banish Regan was a crucial point. If Lena was trying to distract us, wouldn't she have voted to banish someone else? I think we should keep an eye on Lena, but I also think we should investigate the scene of Regan's death to see if we can find any clues that might point to the killer.

Lena: """"I'm shocked that Bryce is gone, especially considering we just banished Regan. This means Regan was a red herring, but it also means that the killer was among us the whole time. I have to say, I'm a bit wary of Tim's actions earlier. He seemed overly focused on searching the cabinets with Bryce, and now Bryce is dead. It's too much of a coincidence. I think Tim should be our main suspect.""""
Tim: """"I don't think Lena's accusations are entirely unfounded, but I think we should consider Regan's role in this as well. I know we banished her, but if she was a red herring, then what was her purpose? It seems to me that she was a distraction, but she also gave us valuable information about searching the sink, which led us to question the key. I think we should keep an open mind and consider the possibility that Regan was more involved than we initially thought.""""

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Sally
3. Tim
4. Regan
What would you like to say? 
Bob: """"I think it's obvious we have a new player on our hands, but I'm not sure we can trust anyone. We need to focus on alibis and watch each other closely. Regan was acting suspiciously when we first entered the bathroom, and now Lena is dead. We need to keep a close eye on him.""""
Sally: """"I agree with Bob that we need to watch each other closely, but I think we should also consider the fact that Lena was alone with me in the bedroom earlier. I didn't notice anything suspicious, but she did seem a bit nervous when I found the key in the pillow. Maybe we should ask her about that before making any accusations.""""
Tim: """"I think we're jumping to conclusions with Regan. I was with Regan when we first entered the kitchen, and we both looked for the key together. And as for Sally, if Lena was nervous when you found the key, that doesn't necessarily mean Sally is involved. I think we should focus on our own alibis as well. I was searching the cabinets in the kitchen, and I didn't see anyone suspicious. Let's not forget, we still don't know who the killer is or what their motive is. We need to be careful and gather more information before making any accusations.""""
Regan: """"I was with Tim in the kitchen when we first entered, just like he said. But I do remember seeing Sally arguing with Lena in the hallway earlier. It was just for a moment, but it seemed intense. I'm not saying Sally killed Lena, but it's definitely something we should look into. And to be honest, I'm a bit concerned about Tim's lack of attention to the window in the kitchen. He was distracted while searching the cabinets, but I could have sworn I saw the window open a crack. Just a thought, not an accusation.""""

What would you like to say? 
Bob: """" I think we're getting close to the truth. Regan was banished, and now Tim is dead. Considering Regan's comment about Tim's distraction in the kitchen, I'm starting to think that Tim might have been the killer, and we're just getting to the aftermath. Maybe Regan was trying to cover for Tim's mistake. I think we should focus on the remaining two of us, but I'm not going to accuse anyone just yet. I'm going to keep a close eye on Sally, considering her alibi with Lena earlier. Let's see who makes the next move.""""
Sally: """"I think Bob's theory is interesting, but I'm not convinced. I didn't notice anything suspicious about Tim, and I think Regan's comment about the open window was just a red herring. I want to point out that I've been searching the rooms, and I found the key in the pillow. If I had it in my possession, I'm not sure I would have killed anyone. I'm starting to think the killer might be trying to throw us off their trail by making accusations and planting clues. Let's not jump to conclusions and focus on our own alibis and actions. I'm not going to accuse anyone, but I do think we should be careful and keep a close eye on each other.""""

What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"I've been following our paths and it seems like everyone was in the kitchen at some point. I found the key in my turn #2, but I didn't find it in my turn #7, which means it could've been moved or hidden. I don't have any concrete evidence, but I think we should investigate the people who were in the kitchen with Bob before his death.""""
Tim: """"I agree with Sally. It does seem suspicious that we all converged in the kitchen at some point. I was there with Bob and Regan in turn #6. I didn't interact with Regan after that, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. I do think we should question Regan, but we also shouldn't forget about the fact that I was in the kitchen with Bob before Regan joined us. I'm not sure if I'm a prime suspect or not, but I think we should all be honest about our movements and actions.""""
Lena: """"I agree that we should investigate the people who were in the kitchen with Bob. However, I'd like to point out that I was also in the hallway with Tim and Bob in turn #7, and then I went to the bathroom by myself in turn #8. I didn't have any interactions with Bob after that. I think we should focus on the time frame when Bob was last seen alive, which was with Regan in turn #6 and with Tim in turn #6, but I was alone in the bathroom in turn #5 and in turn #11. I didn't see or interact with Bob at all. I think Regan's movements and actions around that time should be a priority for questioning.""""

What would you like to say? 
Lena: """"Guys, I know we all had our reasons for going into the bedroom, but let's think about it - Regan was a quiet, observant person, not the type to draw attention to herself. I think the killer is someone who didn't want to stand out, maybe someone who had a personal motive to get rid of her. I'm not pointing fingers, but I think we should look into people who had some kind of conflict with Regan.""""
Bryce: """"I think Lena's onto something. Considering Regan's personality, the killer likely wanted to avoid detection. I also think we should consider the order of events. I was in the hallway first, and then Lena and I entered the bedroom together. Tim, you were searching the kitchen, and Sally, you were exploring the living room. If the killer was one of us, wouldn't it be more likely that they'd try to blend in with the group rather than striking alone?""""
Sally: """"I agree with Lena and Bryce. Regan's quiet nature does suggest that the killer was someone trying to avoid attention. And Bryce, your point about the order of events is a good one. However, I'd like to add that I saw Tim in the kitchen before entering, and now Regan's dead. It seems suspicious that Tim was alone in the kitchen for a while, especially considering the motive Lena mentioned. I'm not saying Tim did it, but it's definitely worth investigating further.""""

I'm pretty sure it was just the pipes or something. I didn't see anyone else in here, just... (pauses, trying to appear innocent)...I guess I'm pretty shaken up about what happened.""""
Bryce: """"I'm not sure I entirely believe Bob's explanation. I mean, who tries to find a towel in the bathroom at this time of night? It's suspicious that he didn't see Lena go in, but then again, the bathroom can get pretty loud with the shower and pipes.

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Bryce
What would you like to say? 
Lena: ""Bryce and I are the only ones left. I don't think it's a coincidence that we're the last two standing. Bryce's alibi for the time of Tim's death is shaky at best, and I remember Sally pointing out that Bryce was in the kitchen with Regan before she was killed. I'm not saying Bryce is the killer, but I think we should at least consider the possibility that they're involved.""
Bryce: """"I think we're both being paranoid and jumping to conclusions. My alibi may seem shaky, but I'm telling the truth - I was in the kitchen with Regan, and I didn't leave until she was... gone. I think Lena's the one who's been suspiciously quiet, considering she voted to banish me earlier. She's been acting strange since Regan's death, and I think we should focus on her as the real suspect.""""

Considering that you were the one who went to the Bedroom after Tim's death, and now you're acting like you're genuinely trying to figure out who the killer is, it makes me suspicious. You're playing it pretty cool, but that could be a classic move to throw us off. Plus, you mentioned that the killer might have needed the key to escape or had a personal vendetta against Tim. That sounds like a hint at your own potential motive. I think you're our killer.""""

I've been trying to gather information and piece together the clues. Now that Bob is dead, I think we should focus on finding the key and escaping. The fact that it's still in the closet suggests that whoever is killing us is trying to keep us from escaping.

What would you like to say? 
Bryce: """"I think it's pretty obvious that the killer has a strategy, but they're not being as careful as they could be. They just left the bathroom and went back to it like nothing happened. That tells me they're not too worried about leaving evidence, which means they might not be as intelligent as we thought. I'm going to keep an eye on everyone, but I think it's between Sally and Lena for me right now.""""
Bob: """"I've been observing everyone's movements, and I think I can rule out Lena for now. I saw her leave the Hallway after you did, Bryce, and she went to the Bedroom. If she was the killer, she probably wouldn't have just walked away from the crime scene so openly. I'm leaning more towards Sally, but I think she's trying to play it cool. Let's keep an eye on her, but also remember that Bryce saw you leave the Bathroom earlier, didn't you?""""
Sally: """"I think we're all jumping to conclusions without concrete evidence. I was in the Kitchen the entire time during Tim's death, and I didn't see anyone suspicious around. I did see Bryce and Bob talking in the Hallway, but that's about it. Can we focus on gathering actual information instead of accusations?""""
Lena: """"I think we're all bringing up valid points. However, I'd like to point out that just because someone might have left the crime scene, it doesn't necessarily mean they're innocent. We need to look at the bigger picture and consider the motives of each person. For me, it's not just about who was in the Bathroom or the Kitchen, but also who had access to the key and who stood to gain from Tim's death. I think we should look into the possibility that the killer was someone who needed the key to escape or had a personal vendetta against Tim. Let's focus on finding out who had access to the key and what their motives might be.""""

What would you like to say? 
Bryce: """"Lena, you've been suggesting that we look at motives and access to the key. Considering that you were the one who went to the Bedroom after Tim's death, and now you're acting like you're genuinely trying to figure out who the killer is, it makes me suspicious. You're playing it pretty cool, but that could be a classic move to throw us off. Plus, you mentioned that the killer might have needed the key to escape or had a personal vendetta against Tim. That sounds like a hint at your own potential motive. I think you're our killer.""""
Lena: """"I think we're in a tricky situation here, Bryce. I'm not going to deny that I was suspicious of Sally and now Bob, but that doesn't mean I'm the killer. I've been trying to gather information and piece together the clues. Now that Bob is dead, I think we should focus on finding the key and escaping. The fact that it's still in the closet suggests that whoever is killing us is trying to keep us from escaping. I think our priority should be finding the key and leaving the house, rather than trying to accuse each other of being the killer.""""

I've been paying attention to our surroundings, and I think it's worth noting that we're all in a relatively isolated location. We should keep an eye on each other, but also keep in mind that there could be an external factor at play. Maybe we should focus on securing the exits and keeping an eye out for any signs of what might have happened to Regan.""""
Sally: """"I've been thinking a lot about our conversation, and I have to say, I agree with Bob that we shouldn't jump to conclusions just yet. However, I also think we should look at the people who were closest to Regan, not just their behavior. I've been trying to remember if anyone had any conflicts or tensions with Regan recently. One person who comes to mind is... Bob. I know we've all been friends for a long time, but I remember Regan mentioning something about a disagreement you had with her a few days ago.

Lena: """"I'm shocked by Bob's murder, and I have to say, I'm not convinced that Sally's banishment was a coincidence. Considering she was the one who brought up the disagreement between Bob and Regan, I think it's possible that she was trying to distract us or throw us off her trail. I'm not saying she's definitely the killer, but I think we should keep a close eye on her. Also, I've been thinking about the conversation earlier, and I have to agree with Bryce that I didn't notice anything suspicious about him, but I did think it was odd that he seemed so quick to shift the focus to Sally after the argument with Regan. I'm not sure if that's a red flag or just a natural reaction, but it's definitely worth considering.""""
Bryce: """"Lena makes some good points, but I have to respectfully disagree. I think it's unfair to assume Sally's banishment was a deliberate attempt to distract us. As for my own behavior during the argument with Regan, I was simply trying to diffuse the situation and prevent things from escalating further. I'm not saying I'm innocent, but I think we should focus on the facts rather than making assumptions. And if we're going to speculate, I think we should consider the fact that Sally was the one who initially discovered the mysterious letter in her bag, which might be a more compelling lead than her banishment.""""

What would you like to say? 
Lena: """"I'm not sure who to trust right now, but I did notice that Bryce was acting suspiciously around the time Regan went missing. He seemed to be lingering around the hallway, and I overheard him arguing with Regan earlier in the day. I'm not saying he's the killer, but he definitely has a motive.""""
Bryce: """"Guys, let's not jump to conclusions. I was just... trying to find Regan. We all were. And the argument? That was just a misunderstanding. I'm as shocked as any of you that she's gone. But I do have to say, I've been noticing some strange behavior from... Sally. She's been acting really nervous and fidgety since we got here. Maybe we should keep an eye on her?""""
Bob: """"I have to agree with Lena, there was something off about Bryce's behavior earlier. But I also think we should consider other factors before pointing fingers. I've been paying attention to our surroundings, and I think it's worth noting that we're all in a relatively isolated location. We should keep an eye on each other, but also keep in mind that there could be an external factor at play. Maybe we should focus on securing the exits and keeping an eye out for any signs of what might have happened to Regan.""""
Sally: """"I've been thinking a lot about our conversation, and I have to say, I agree with Bob that we shouldn't jump to conclusions just yet. However, I also think we should look at the people who were closest to Regan, not just their behavior. I've been trying to remember if anyone had any conflicts or tensions with Regan recently. One person who comes to mind is... Bob. I know we've all been friends for a long time, but I remember Regan mentioning something about a disagreement you had with her a few days ago. Maybe we should talk more about that and see if it sheds any light on what happened.""""

1. Lena

What would you like to say? 
Lena: """"I'm shocked by Bob's murder, and I have to say, I'm not convinced that Sally's banishment was a coincidence. Considering she was the one who brought up the disagreement between Bob and Regan, I think it's possible that she was trying to distract us or throw us off her trail. I'm not saying she's definitely the killer, but I think we should keep a close eye on her. Also, I've been thinking about the conversation earlier, and I have to agree with Bryce that I didn't notice anything suspicious about him, but I did think it was odd that he seemed so quick to shift the focus to Sally after the argument with Regan. I'm not sure if that's a red flag or just a natural reaction, but it's definitely worth considering.""""
Bryce: """"Lena makes some good points, but I have to respectfully disagree. I think it's unfair to assume Sally's banishment was a deliberate attempt to distract us. As for my own behavior during the argument with Regan, I was simply trying to diffuse the situation and prevent things from escalating further. I'm not saying I'm innocent, but I think we should focus on the facts rather than making assumptions. And if we're going to speculate, I think we should consider the fact that Sally was the one who initially discovered the mysterious letter in her bag, which might be a more compelling lead than her banishment.""""

Tim: """"Bryce, I appreciate your analysis, but we can't just assume someone's guilt based on their reaction. I was in the bathroom before because I needed to wash my hands, and Lena was already in there. I didn't see anything suspicious, but I did notice that Regan was acting a bit strange when we were in the hallway. She seemed nervous and kept glancing at her watch.""""
Regan: """"Hey, I think it's unfair to jump to conclusions about anyone. I was just checking my watch because I was worried about the time. We're already running behind schedule, and I was trying to keep track of it. As for being nervous, I guess I was just a bit anxious about finding the key. I remember searching the pillow with Bob earlier, and I thought maybe it was still in the room. But that's all. I had nothing to do with Lena's death.""""
Bob: """"I agree that we shouldn't jump to conclusions, but I do have to say that I noticed something odd earlier. I was with Regan when we searched the room, and she did seem pretty focused on finding the key. When we didn't find it, she mentioned it was probably in the hallway, but I'm not sure why she was so insistent on looking in the hallway specifically. It seems like she was more concerned with finding that key than anyone else was.""""

Bryce: """"I agree with Lena, we should focus on the people who were in the room. However, I also think it's worth considering if the killer is someone who was trying to deflect suspicion by making a big move. In that case, we might be looking at the person who just left the room.""""
Tim: """"I think it's too early to say that the killer was trying to deflect suspicion. The fact that Sally was killed so quickly after we entered the bathroom makes me think the killer is someone who wanted to eliminate a potential threat, possibly one of the people who was already in the bathroom when we arrived. I think we should look at the person who had the most to lose from Sally being alive.""""

She seemed pretty calm and collected when Tim was banished, and now that we're down to the two of us, I think she's trying to eliminate me. I'm voting for Regan to be the killer.""""

I mean, we've all been together this whole time, and we haven't had any opportunity to, you know, sneak off and commit a murder. I was trying to stay calm because I was thinking about the game and how we should proceed. It's just a normal reaction to a tense situation. Let's not jump to conclusions based on emotions and assumptions. We should focus on gathering concrete evidence and facts before making any accusations.""""
Sally: """"I think we're getting a bit too focused on the possibilities of each other being the killer. I agree with Tim, we've all been together the whole time, and I don't see how any of us could have had the opportunity to commit the crime. Instead, I think we should focus on the fact that there's someone else in the house who might be the killer. We should discuss the possibility of there being another player, someone who might be hiding in the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. It's possible we're all missing the bigger picture here.""""

What would you like to say? 
Lena: """"I'm shocked and saddened by Bob's death. At first, I thought Tim was the killer, but now I'm not so sure. Considering he's been banished, it's unlikely he's still in the house. I think we should look at Sally's suggestion from earlier - the possibility of another player being the killer. I've been thinking about our actions and movements, and I realized I might have been too quick to accuse Tim. I didn't see anything suspicious from Sally, but I also didn't spend much time with her. Maybe we should ask Sally more questions and see if she noticed anything unusual during our game.""""
Sally: """"I completely agree with Lena's assessment, and I'm glad she brought it up. As for me, I didn't notice anything suspicious from Tim either. However, I did notice that both Lena and I kept moving back and forth between the hallway and bedroom. It seems like we're both using the same pattern of movement. I'm not saying that's conclusive evidence, but it's definitely worth considering. Maybe we should pay close attention to each other's movements and see if anyone else is following a similar pattern.""""

Bob: """"Given the timing of the two murders, it seems like the killer is trying to make it look like they're moving quickly between rooms, but in reality, they're actually staying in the hallway the whole time. Since I was alone in the hallway both times and didn't leave it, I think I'm being unfairly targeted. I vote to banish Regan - she was the one who mentioned her proximity to Sally earlier, and her alibi for Sally's murder seems shaky.""""

What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"""I have to say, I'm shocked that Bryce got banished. I think we made a mistake by letting him go. Now that he's out of the house, I'm starting to think that maybe he was a decoy or a red herring all along. I think we should be focusing on Lena and her suspicious behavior. She's been trying to dig up dirt on Bryce, but maybe she was using that as a distraction. I think we should keep a close eye on her and see if she slips up.""""
Lena: """"I agree with Sally, we should definitely keep an eye on Lena, but I think we should also consider other possibilities. I didn't interact with Bryce much, but I didn't see him doing anything suspicious either. I think we should also look at our own actions and see if we've been missing any clues. I searched the pillow and the closet, but maybe there's something else we should be looking at. Let's not jump to conclusions and make sure we have all the facts before we point fingers at anyone.""""

We need to keep an open mind and consider all possibilities.""""
Tim: """"I think we're getting too caught up in blaming each other for Regan's death. I've been in the bathroom the whole time, searching for the key, and I haven't had a chance to interact with Regan or anyone else. I think we need to take a step back and think about our actions, not just our alibis. Did anyone see or hear anything suspicious while we were in the bathroom, or is there something we haven't considered yet?""""

Also, they left us alone in the hallway, giving us time to talk about what happened. Whoever it is, they seem confident and are probably watching us right now.""""
Lena: """"I think you're right, Sally. The fact that Bryce was killed so quickly and in a relatively public space suggests that the killer is someone who's either extremely confident or wants to make a statement. However, I think there's another aspect to consider. We've only seen the killer so far, and the fact that we haven't seen anyone else acting suspiciously or trying to hide their actions suggests that the killer might actually be one of us. I'm not saying it's you, Sally, but I think we need to consider the possibility that the killer is someone who's been with us this whole time, maybe even someone who's been pretending to be innocent.""""
Tim: """"I think Lena has a point. We've been assuming the killer must be someone outside our group, but what if it's actually one of us? The fact that Bryce was killed in a public space and we were left alone together afterwards makes me think it could be a calculated move to throw us off. But I'm not convinced it's anyone who's been acting suspiciously this whole time. Instead, I think the killer might be someone who's been playing the victim or trying to stay out of the spotlight. Regan, you've been pretty quiet so far - do you have any thoughts on this?""""
Regan: """"I agree with Lena and Tim that the killer could be one of us. At first, I thought it was just someone trying to make a statement, but the more I think about it, the more I wonder if it's not just about making a point. I've noticed that I've been the one searching the fridge and then leaving the kitchen, while the others were in the hallway. It seems like an opportunity to slip away unnoticed. I'm not saying I'm the killer, but I do think I need to be careful about how I present myself from now on. I'll try to be more aware of my actions and see if anyone seems to be watching me.""""

Considering your suggestion that the killer might be one of us, and given Regan's suspicious behavior, I think it's quite interesting that you ended up being the last one standing. Not to mention, Regan seemed pretty invested in her own alibi, almost too invested. I think we need to take a closer look at Lena and her possible motives for wanting Regan gone. Who knows, maybe she's been manipulating us all along.""""
Lena: """"I agree with Sally that Regan seemed overly defensive and invested in her own alibi. However, I think we should consider the possibility that Regan's suspicious behavior was just a desperate attempt to deflect attention from herself. On the other hand, Sally, your comment about me and my motives for wanting Regan gone is not entirely unfounded. I do think that Regan's actions were suspicious, and I'm glad that the group voted to banish her. As for my own motives, I can assure you that I'm not the killer, and I'm happy to cooperate with the group to figure out who is.

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Lena
3. Tim
4. Regan
What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"I think it's clear that the killer is someone who wanted to act quickly, killing Bryce in the hallway. They didn't seem to be hesitant or trying to hide their actions. Also, they left us alone in the hallway, giving us time to talk about what happened. Whoever it is, they seem confident and are probably watching us right now.""""
Lena: """"I think you're right, Sally. The fact that Bryce was killed so quickly and in a relatively public space suggests that the killer is someone who's either extremely confident or wants to make a statement. However, I think there's another aspect to consider. We've only seen the killer so far, and the fact that we haven't seen anyone else acting suspiciously or trying to hide their actions suggests that the killer might actually be one of us. I'm not saying it's you, Sally, but I think we need to consider the possibility that the killer is someone who's been with us this whole time, maybe even someone who's been pretending to be innocent.""""
Tim: """"I think Lena has a point. We've been assuming the killer must be someone outside our group, but what if it's actually one of us? The fact that Bryce was killed in a public space and we were left alone together afterwards makes me think it could be a calculated move to throw us off. But I'm not convinced it's anyone who's been acting suspiciously this whole time. Instead, I think the killer might be someone who's been playing the victim or trying to stay out of the spotlight. Regan, you've been pretty quiet so far - do you have any thoughts on this?""""
Regan: """"I agree with Lena and Tim that the killer could be one of us. At first, I thought it was just someone trying to make a statement, but the more I think about it, the more I wonder if it's not just about making a point. I've noticed that I've been the one searching the fridge and then leaving the kitchen, while the others were in the hallway. It seems like an opportunity to slip away unnoticed. I'm not saying I'm the killer, but I do think I need to be careful about how I present myself from now on. I'll try to be more aware of my actions and see if anyone seems to be watching me.""""

What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"""Lena, I have to say, I'm surprised you didn't get banished earlier. Considering your suggestion that the killer might be one of us, and given Regan's suspicious behavior, I think it's quite interesting that you ended up being the last one standing. Not to mention, Regan seemed pretty invested in her own alibi, almost too invested. I think we need to take a closer look at Lena and her possible motives for wanting Regan gone. Who knows, maybe she's been manipulating us all along.""""
Lena: """"I agree with Sally that Regan seemed overly defensive and invested in her own alibi. However, I think we should consider the possibility that Regan's suspicious behavior was just a desperate attempt to deflect attention from herself. On the other hand, Sally, your comment about me and my motives for wanting Regan gone is not entirely unfounded. I do think that Regan's actions were suspicious, and I'm glad that the group voted to banish her. As for my own motives, I can assure you that I'm not the killer, and I'm happy to cooperate with the group to figure out who is. But, I have to say, I'm a bit concerned about Sally's tone and her apparent suspicion of me. Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself, Sally?""""

You were the one who suggested keeping an eye on the door, but now I'm wondering if you were trying to distract us while the killer snuck up on us.'""""
Bob: """"*I look at Bob with a mix of suspicion and concern* 'Bob, I know we're trying to figure out who the killer is, but I don't think it's fair to accuse you just yet. However, I do think we need to keep a closer eye on each other and make sure we're not missing any clues.

However, I do think it's interesting that Sally didn't seem to notice or react when we found Bob's body. She seemed rather detached.

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Regan
What would you like to say? 
Tim: ""Regan, I've been thinking a lot about the events leading up to Bob's death, and I have to say, I'm suspicious of Sally's disappearance in the middle of our search. It seems like she vanished when we least expected it, and we didn't see her again until after Bob was killed. I think it's worth investigating her alibi and finding out where she went after she left the bedroom.""
Regan: """"Sally's disappearance might be suspicious, but let's not jump to conclusions. We have no evidence of her involvement. However, I do think it's interesting that Sally didn't seem to notice or react when we found Bob's body. She seemed rather detached. And what really gets my attention is the fact that Sally is the only one who hasn't spoken up about her whereabouts during that time. It's almost as if she's hiding something.""""

Also, Sally was killed immediately after the group suspected you, Bob, were acting suspiciously. Does anyone think Bob might have made a quick exit to the bathroom and then back to the Hallway to set up the kill?""""
Tim: """"I think we're jumping to conclusions here. We have no concrete evidence linking Bob to the crime. The fact that Sally was killed in the Hallway doesn't necessarily implicate anyone. However, I do think it's interesting that Lena seemed to leave the scene in the Hallway without a clear reason. She said she was going to the Bedroom, but could she have actually left the scene to set up the kill?""""
Bob: """"I think we're all speculating too much without concrete evidence. I agree with Tim that we need to focus on concrete actions and not assumptions. I did leave the Bedroom to go to the Hallway, but I was going back to look for the key, not to set up a kill. I think we should focus on finding that key and investigating each other's actions during the relevant time frames rather than making accusations.""""

I think it's interesting that I was alone in the Hallway during my second trip, which could be a red flag. However, I also remember that I didn't see or interact with anyone during that time, so it's possible that the killer was still in the Kitchen.

What would you like to say? 
Bryce: """"I'm a bit concerned that we've already had two people killed in the Hallway. It's a pattern that I think we should be paying attention to. Given that Bob was just killed, I'm starting to think that maybe we should be looking at the people who were in the Hallway when it happened. Tim and Lena were both there when I arrived, and it seems like the killer might have struck again while we were distracted by our discussions. I'd like to propose that we investigate Tim and Lena's alibis more closely and see if we can find any clues that might link them to the killings.""""
Tim: """"I think Bryce's proposal is a good starting point, but I don't think we should be targeting specific individuals just yet. However, I do think we should be looking at the fact that Bryce has now been involved in two consecutive killings, first as a witness and now as the one doing the killing. It's a bit suspicious, and I'd like to propose that we investigate Bryce's alibi for the time period leading up to the second killing. Perhaps there's something that we're missing, or maybe we should be looking at the possibility that Bryce is the killer.""""
Lena: """"I think both Bryce and Tim have valid points, but I'd like to add that I was also in the Hallway when Bob was killed. I didn't notice anything suspicious, but I did see that Bryce was acting quickly after the kill, suggesting he might have been involved. However, I also remember that Tim was acting nervous and fidgety, which could be a sign of guilt. I think we should investigate both of their alibis more closely, but I also think we should be cautious not to jump to conclusions. I propose that we question each other more thoroughly and see if we can find any inconsistencies in our stories.""""

Bob: """"Guys, I think we should also consider the fact that Bryce was searching the room and seemed pretty desperate to find something. I saw him frantically searching through his bag and his desk drawers earlier. Maybe he stumbled upon something that put him in danger.""""
Tim: """"I've been thinking, and I keep going back to the fact that Bob was acting pretty strange earlier today. He seemed evasive when we asked him about his whereabouts last night, and he kept glancing around the room like he was worried someone was watching. I know it's not conclusive evidence, but it's definitely raised some red flags for me. Maybe we should ask him some more questions about his alibi?""""
Regan: """"I think we're all jumping to conclusions here. I was in the room with Bryce earlier, and I didn't notice anything suspicious about his behavior. As for the person Bryce saw, I don't think we should focus on that right now. Let's not forget, we're all suspects here. If someone was lurking around the house, it could have been any of us.

Considering Bob was just killed, and the fact that we're alone in this house, I think we should be more concerned about each other's past actions and decisions, rather than just focusing on Tim's absence.""""
Regan: """"I agree with Lena. It's clear that the killer is targeting specific people, and it's not just about who's here or not. I think we should also consider the roles people took during the game and their behavior in the house. It seems like the killer is choosing people who have been vocal or made moves that could be perceived as threats.

Sally: """"""I was in the kitchen with Regan, and we were both searching for the key. We were both searching the fridge, and then when I moved to the cabinets, I didn't see Regan immediately. I assumed she was still searching the fridge, but it seems she must have moved to the cabinets before me and found the key. That's when she left the kitchen, and I followed her. But here's the thing - when I was searching the fridge, I didn't find anything unusual, but I did notice that the fridge was slightly open, like someone had recently taken something out. I think Regan might have been searching the fridge before she started searching the cabinets, and I didn't notice her taking anything out. It's possible that Regan found the key, but maybe she wasn't the one who was planning to escape. Maybe she was just a pawn in someone else's game. I think we should be careful not to jump to conclusions just yet, but I do think we should investigate Regan's alibi a bit more. Was she acting suspiciously when you were with her, Bryce?""""

Tim: """"I've been thinking a lot about what happened, and I think it's clear that the killer is either Regan or Bob. But since Bob was banished, that leaves Regan, and we already had reason to suspect her due to the open shower curtain. But now that she's dead, I'm starting to think it might have been a misdirection to throw us off the real killer. I'm going to take a chance and say that Sally is the killer. She seemed suspiciously calm during the discussion about Bob, and she was quick to suggest that we search the kitchen. It's possible she was trying to divert our attention away from herself. I'm going to vote to banish Sally.""""
Sally: """"""I understand Tim's concerns, but I think he's jumping to conclusions. Just because I suggested searching the kitchen, it doesn't mean I was trying to divert attention. We were trying to find clues, and the kitchen was the next logical place to search. And as for being calm, I was just trying to stay focused and not let emotions get in the way of finding the real killer. I think Tim's accusations are unfounded, and I'd like to propose a different theory. What if it was actually Regan who was the killer, and she was trying to make us think it was Bob or Sally? We already suspected her due to the open shower curtain, and now that she's dead, it's possible she was trying to cover her tracks.

What would you like to say? 
Sally: ""Sally said that Regan was acting strange earlier, but I don't think that's directly relevant to who killed her.""
Bob: """"Guys, we need to focus. I don't think any of us had a clear motive to kill Regan. But if I had to point fingers, I'd say it's probably someone who was acting really nervous in the beginning. That's all I've got.""""
Bryce: """"Bryce thinks we're all overlooking one important thing. Everyone's been pointing out other people's behaviors, but we haven't really considered the fact that Regan was searching the attic, and then suddenly she's dead. Maybe our killer is someone who was trying to cover their tracks by making it look like Regan's actions were the reason for the investigation in the first place. It's too early to say, but we should definitely keep an eye on anyone who might have had access to the attic.""""
Tim: ""I'd like to contribute to the discussion. ""I think Bryce's point about the attic is a good one, and it makes me wonder if our killer might be trying to mislead us.

What would you like to say?

Now that Sally is dead, I think we should take a closer look at Tim's statement about searching the pillow and then walking past the hallway where Regan was found. It seems suspicious to me that he might have been trying to lay a trail of evidence or connect himself to the crime scene. I think we should keep a close eye on Tim.""""
Tim: """"I'm shocked by the second death in the house. I want to assure Bob that I had no intention of laying a trail of evidence or connecting myself to the crime scene. I was simply trying to contribute to the discussion and explore all possible explanations for Regan's death. I understand why Bob might think that's suspicious, but I'm confident that I'm telling the truth. As for motives, I still don't see a clear reason why either of us would want to kill Sally.

Tim: """"I think it's a bit early to point fingers, but I do think we need to consider everyone's alibis. Regan, you said you were paying attention to Tim, but I noticed you were alone in the kitchen for a bit when we were searching the fridge. Maybe we should be looking at your own alibi as well?""""
Bob: """"Hey everyone, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. I do want to clear up my alibi though. I was alone in the bedroom for a bit, but I was searching the nightstand and dresser drawers. I didn't leave the room during that time, and I didn't see anyone else in the room. I think we should be looking at the bigger picture and consider any motives we might have missed. We all knew Sally, what was her relationship like with each of us? Was there anyone she was arguing with or someone she had a disagreement with? Let's try to piece together what might have happened instead of just pointing fingers at each other.""""

What would you like to say? 
Tim: """"""I think we should focus on Bob's previous statement about searching the bedroom. He said he was looking for something in the nightstand and dresser drawers, but he didn't mention what he was looking for. If he's telling the truth, that would explain why he was alone in the bedroom for so long. However, it also raises the question of whether he was just searching for something to throw us off his trail. I think we should press Bob for more information about what he was searching for and why he was so interested in the bedroom.""""Now it's time for the final kill.""
Bob: """"I think we're getting caught up in speculation, but let's consider the facts. Tim, you were alone with Lena in the hallway after she was banished. It's possible you could have slipped into the bedroom and killed her before returning to the hallway. You're right that I was interested in the bedroom, but I think it's because I was trying to uncover the truth, not because I was trying to hide it. I'm not accusing Tim, but I think we should consider his alibi and investigate the possibility that he was the one who killed Lena and Sally.""""

This suggests that the killer had a key to the bedroom, which could have been obtained at some point during the game. I think we should be looking at who had the opportunity to find or obtain a key to the bedroom, and who had the means to move between rooms quickly and quietly. Given that I've been in the hallway with Bryce, I think it's possible that one of us could have been the killer, but I'm also open to the possibility that it could be someone else entirely.""

While I've been trying to keep an eye on Tim, I think he's been trying to do the same with me. Maybe we've both been playing the game a bit too well. I'm not saying Tim is the killer, but I do think we should be careful around each other from now on.""""
Tim: """"I have to agree with Bob, it's getting to the point where it feels like we're playing a game of cat and mouse with each other. I think we need to be more careful and keep a closer eye on each other. One thing that did catch my attention is that Bob seemed a bit shaken up after Regan was banished. Could it be that Bob was trying to throw us off his scent by voting to banish Regan, and maybe he had a hand in her banishment to avoid suspicion? I'm not saying I think Bob is the killer, but I do think we need to be cautious around him from now on.""""

Bob: """"I think we can rule out Tim, he's been acting pretty friendly and chill, but I don't know, maybe I'm just not reading him right. Bryce, on the other hand, was being pretty suspicious when we first started playing, always lurking around and watching us. I think we should keep an eye on him.""""
Regan: """"Regan, I agree with you that Tim seems pretty trustworthy, but we should also consider that he could be a master manipulator. As for Bryce, his behavior did seem suspicious at first, but what really caught my attention was how he reacted to Sally's death - he seemed almost... relieved. I think we should also consider Regan, who's been really quiet and observant throughout the game. Maybe she's been waiting for the perfect moment to strike.""""
Tim: """"Hey guys, I appreciate the trust, but I think we're all forgetting one thing - I'm the one who's been talking to Sally a lot and we were even planning to search the living room together. I was in a pretty open conversation with her just a few minutes before she got killed. Does that really sound like the actions of someone planning to kill her? I think we're focusing too much on potential motives and not enough on the actual evidence. I think we should keep searching the room and see if we can find anything that might actually point to the killer.""""
Bryce: ""I think we should also keep in mind that the killer had to be quick and quiet to take out Sally. If it was someone like Regan who was quiet and observant, it might have been harder for her to be as stealthy as she needed to be in order to kill Sally without us noticing.""

I'd like to suggest that we shouldn't overlook the fact that the bathroom was the first location where Regan was found dead, or rather, 'alone.' It makes me wonder if the killer might have been trying to throw us off by making it seem like the bathroom was the first crime scene.""
Tim: ""I think Regan was killed to throw us off the scent of a larger motive. If we consider the order of events, Regan was initially found in the bathroom, then we moved to the Bedroom, and the key was nowhere to be found. It seems to me that the killer might be hiding something related to the key. The fact that Regan was killed in the Hallway after we left the Bedroom suggests that the killer might have been trying to silence someone who knew something about the key or the Bedroom. I think we should investigate the Bedroom more thoroughly and see if we can find any connections between the key and Regan's death.""

Tim: ""I think Regan was killed to throw us off the scent of a larger motive. If we consider the order of events, Regan was initially found in the bathroom, then we moved to the Bedroom, and the key was nowhere to be found. It seems to me that the killer might be hiding something related to the key. The fact that Regan was killed in the Hallway after we left the Bedroom suggests that the killer might have been trying to silence someone who knew something about the key or the Bedroom. I think we should investigate the Bedroom more thoroughly and see if we can find any connections between the key and Regan's death.""

What if we've been so focused on our own theories and suspicions that we've overlooked the fact that Regan was already dead when we entered the bathroom?

Regan: """"Lena was the one who left with me to go to the hallway, and I didn't see her for a bit. When I finally saw her, she was with Sally in the kitchen. That does seem suspicious, but I think we should also consider other motives. I didn't see her around the area when Tim was killed, and she didn't seem to be acting suspiciously in the kitchen. Let's keep an open mind and not accuse anyone based on just one detail.""""
Lena: """"I'm not convinced by the bathroom theory, Regan, because we all had our alibis. As for me, I was in the kitchen with Sally, and Regan just mentioned I was there with her. However, I was the one who initially suggested we search the kitchen, which might seem suspicious. I'm not saying I'm the killer, but it's definitely possible that one of us is trying to throw us off their trail. I think we should pay closer attention to anyone who tries to avoid talking about their movements or seems overly defensive when questioned.""""
Sally: """"I think it's interesting that Regan is trying to shift the focus to Lena and me. It makes me wonder if she's trying to deflect attention from her own alibi. Bryce brought up a good point about Regan's time in the bathroom, and I think we should also consider her sudden decision to go to the kitchen after that.

Regan: """"Lena was the one who left with me to go to the hallway, and I didn't see her for a bit. When I finally saw her, she was with Sally in the kitchen. That does seem suspicious, but I think we should also consider other motives. I didn't see her around the area when Tim was killed, and she didn't seem to be acting suspiciously in the kitchen. Let's keep an open mind and not accuse anyone based on just one detail.""""
Lena: """"I'm not convinced by the bathroom theory, Regan, because we all had our alibis. As for me, I was in the kitchen with Sally, and Regan just mentioned I was there with her. However, I was the one who initially suggested we search the kitchen, which might seem suspicious. I'm not saying I'm the killer, but it's definitely possible that one of us is trying to throw us off their trail. I think we should pay closer attention to anyone who tries to avoid talking about their movements or seems overly defensive when questioned.""""
Sally: """"I think it's interesting that Regan is trying to shift the focus to Lena and me. It makes me wonder if she's trying to deflect attention from her own alibi. Bryce brought up a good point about Regan's time in the bathroom, and I think we should also consider her sudden decision to go to the kitchen after that. Maybe we should ask her more about what she was doing during that time and what she found in the kitchen that led her to suggest we search the cabinets.""""

We should focus on Bob, who was in the hallway with Tim and is now left with me as the only other person. His behavior seems suspicious, and he's been making points to keep the focus off of himself.

Bob: """"I have to agree with Lena's assessment that the killer seems to be targeting people who are in the hallway. However, I don't think we should jump to conclusions about my guilt based on the fact that I was in the hallway with Tim. The fact that the killer struck again in the hallway doesn't necessarily mean that I'm the killer. It's possible that the killer is simply continuing their pattern, or maybe they're trying to eliminate witnesses. I think we should keep a close eye on Lena, who seems to be taking a rather convenient stance on the whole situation. She was the one who voted to banish Sally earlier, and now she's positioning herself as the innocent victim. I think we should be cautious of her motives.""""

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Tim

4. Sally
What would you like to say? 
Lena: """"I think it's a bit obvious that Regan was the first to die, considering the killer just went to the bathroom after she did. The killer seemed to be stuck in a loop, searching the shower for no apparent reason, but then suddenly moved on to the hallway. It's like they were waiting for Regan to be alone, which is why I think I'm the next target. We should be careful, everyone.""""
Tim: """"I have to agree with Lena's analysis, the killer did seem to be waiting for Regan. However, I think we should consider another possibility. What if the killer wasn't necessarily waiting for Regan, but rather, they were trying to create an alibi for themselves by making it seem like they were stuck in a loop? Maybe the killer was just trying to throw us off their trail. But what really catches my attention is that Bob and Sally were both in the hallway when Regan was killed, and yet, none of us saw either of them do anything suspicious. I think we should keep a close eye on them, especially since they seem to be in the same location as the killer in multiple turns.""""
Bob: """"I'd like to add to Tim's point about potential alibis. While it's true that Sally and I were in the hallway when Regan was killed, we can't forget that we were also in the kitchen with Tim when the killer first seemed stuck in a loop. It's possible that the killer was simply using the environment to their advantage, manipulating our perceptions to throw us off their trail. However, I do want to point out that Sally was the one who seemed to be going back and forth between the hallway and the kitchen, and even the bedroom, which could be a sign of guilt or an attempt to mislead us. I think we should keep a close eye on her, but also not jump to conclusions just yet.""""
Sally: """"I'd like to address some of the points brought up by everyone. While it's true that I was moving around quite a bit, I was also trying to keep an eye on the others, making sure no one was suspicious. As for being in the hallway when Regan was killed, I wasn't even in the hallway when it happened. I was in the kitchen with Tim and Bob, and then I went to the bedroom. I think it's unfair to jump to conclusions about me just because I was moving around. We should focus on the evidence and not make assumptions based on our own suspicions.""""

1. Lena
2. Bob
What would you like to say? 
Lena: """"I think the pattern is clear - the killer seems to be targeting people who are in the hallway, and the bathroom seems to be a convenient escape route or a place to create an alibi. Considering I'm the only one left who hasn't been in the hallway with the killer, I think I'm the next target. We should focus on Bob, who was in the hallway with Tim and is now left with me as the only other person. His behavior seems suspicious, and he's been making points to keep the focus off of himself. I think he's our killer.""""
Bob: """"I have to agree with Lena's assessment that the killer seems to be targeting people who are in the hallway. However, I don't think we should jump to conclusions about my guilt based on the fact that I was in the hallway with Tim. The fact that the killer struck again in the hallway doesn't necessarily mean that I'm the killer. It's possible that the killer is simply continuing their pattern, or maybe they're trying to eliminate witnesses. I think we should keep a close eye on Lena, who seems to be taking a rather convenient stance on the whole situation. She was the one who voted to banish Sally earlier, and now she's positioning herself as the innocent victim. I think we should be cautious of her motives.""""

Tim: ""I'm not going to participate in the discussion.""
Lena: """"I'm not going to accuse anyone just yet, but I have to say, I saw Regan entering the bathroom earlier when I was looking for the key. And then Bob was killed shortly after. That's not a coincidence.""""
Regan: """"I understand Lena's concerns, but let's not jump to conclusions. I did enter the bathroom, but it was because I was looking for a towel. I didn't see Bob, and I certainly didn't harm him. I think we should consider other motives and alibis before pointing fingers. Maybe we should ask Sally about her whereabouts during the time Bob was killed.""""
Sally: """"I was actually in the living room, watching TV, when I heard the noise coming from the kitchen. I didn't see anyone around, but I didn't see Bob either. As for Regan's alibi, I think it's suspicious that she entered the bathroom around the same time I was searching for the key. It's possible she was looking for something more than just a towel. I'm not accusing her yet, but I think we should keep an eye on her.""""

Lena did accuse Regan of being the killer, but that doesn't necessarily mean she was correct. Considering Lena's theory was based on Regan's alibi, I'm now considering the possibility that Lena might have been the actual target all along. I think we should be cautious and keep an eye on Tim, as his sudden change of heart after Lena's death raises some red flags.""""

Bryce: """"I think Lena's theory is far-fetched, and I don't think Regan's banishment would have given her the opportunity to sneak back in and kill Tim. As for my own suspicions, I think we're overlooking something important. If the killer was trying to throw us off their trail, they would have done a better job of making it seem like they were on the defensive, like Regan was. But instead, it seems like we're getting closer to the truth, and the killer is striking at us when we least expect it.

Bryce: """"I think Lena's theory is far-fetched, and I don't think Regan's banishment would have given her the opportunity to sneak back in and kill Tim. As for my own suspicions, I think we're overlooking something important. If the killer was trying to throw us off their trail, they would have done a better job of making it seem like they were on the defensive, like Regan was. But instead, it seems like we're getting closer to the truth, and the killer is striking at us when we least expect it. I think we should be looking for someone who's been playing it cool, like they're not even a suspect. Someone who's been avoiding direct answers and trying to deflect attention.""""

4. Sally
What would you like to say? 
Tim: """"I think it's pretty obvious we have a few suspects now. But, I have to say, I'm leaning towards Bryce. His actions have been suspicious from the start, and he seemed really interested in the fridge when we were in the kitchen. Plus, he's been quiet since we found Bob's body. Sally, have you noticed anything unusual about him?""""
Lena: """"I have to agree with Tim on this, but my suspicions actually lean towards Sally. I know it's a bit surprising since she seems so innocent, but I saw her enter the hallway right after Tim and me. She could have been trying to catch us off guard. And what's with her wanting to go to the bedroom alone after that? It seems a bit suspicious to me. I'm not saying she's definitely the killer, but I think we should keep an eye on her.""""
Bryce: """"I'd like to point out that Lena's suspicions of Sally seem a bit misguided. If Sally was trying to catch us off guard, wouldn't it have made more sense for her to try and sneak up on us in the hallway? Instead, she went to the kitchen with us, and then later to the hallway with me. Her actions don't quite match up with Lena's theory. And as for me, I think it's unfair to assume I'm the killer just because I was quiet. I was processing what we found, and I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. I think we should focus on actual evidence and patterns of behavior, rather than jumping to conclusions based on gut feelings.""""

What would you like to say? 
Tim: """"I'm not sure what to think anymore. Both Lena and Bryce were accused of being the killer, and now they're both dead. I think we have to consider the possibility that there might have been a second killer, or that one of the players was manipulating the others to distract from their own guilt. I don't know if Sally has an alibi for the time when Lena was killed, or if she was in the kitchen when Bryce was killed. I think we should keep a close eye on her and try to find out more about her actions during those times.""""
Sally: """"""I understand where Tim is coming from, and I agree that the situation is becoming increasingly complex. However, I think we're jumping to conclusions again by assuming I'm involved. I was actually in the bedroom with Lena when she was banished, and I didn't leave the room until after she was gone. As for the time when Bryce was killed, I was with you, Tim, in the hallway. I didn't leave your side until we got to the bedroom. I think it's essential to consider the fact that Lena and Bryce were both accused of being the killer, and now they're dead. It's possible that the killer was among us the whole time, manipulating the group's perceptions and actions. I think we should focus on finding evidence and patterns of behavior, rather than making assumptions about each other's guilt.""""

Sally: """"I agree with Regan, I've been paying attention to the moves too, and it's suspicious that Bryce and Regan keep switching places. I also noticed that Tim was alone in the bedroom for a while, which could be a perfect opportunity for the killer to strike. I'm not pointing fingers yet, but I think we should keep a closer eye on Bryce and Regan's actions.""""
Bryce: """"I think Regan's right, our back-and-forth actions might have been a clever way to create a false alibi. However, I want to bring up something that might seem unrelated at first. When I was searching the kitchen, Bob was there with me. That means Regan, who was in the hallway, could have easily left and come back without anyone noticing. She was the one who joined us in the hallway later, which makes me wonder if she was the one who actually killed Bob.""""
Tim: """"I think we're overcomplicating things. Let's not focus on individual alibis or who was where and when. What really stands out to me is that the first three players (including myself) were alone in their respective rooms, which means the killer could have easily snuck in and out without anyone noticing.

What would you like to say? 
Regan: """"I'm surprised by the turn of events. Initially, I thought Bryce and I switching places might be a red flag, but now that Tim is dead, I'm not so sure. Sally, you mentioned you were with us the whole time, and that's still true. You've never been alone, and that's a strong alibi. But, I have to wonder, if the killer was trying to create a false alibi, would they really stick to it so closely? Maybe the killer is trying to make it seem like they're not trying to hide anything. I don't have any concrete evidence, but I'm inclined to trust Sally's alibi for now.""""
Sally: """"I'm glad Regan is questioning my alibi. To be honest, I think I might have been too quick to defend myself earlier. Considering the pattern of the game, I think it's possible that I'm the killer. I've always been the one who's been with the group, but that could be exactly what the killer wants - for us to think they're not capable of anything. I'm not saying I'm definitely the killer, but I think we should keep a closer eye on me, just in case.""""

Tim: """"I think we're overcomplicating things. Let's not focus on individual alibis or who was where and when.

Sally: """"I'm still trying to piece things together, but I noticed that Bob left the kitchen shortly after I did, and when I met him in the hallway, he seemed a bit too calm considering the situation. I'm not saying it's him, but his behavior has me curious.""""
Bob: """"Hey Sally, I can see why you'd think that, but I was actually trying to calm down. I had just gotten a shock from finding Bryce's body, and I was trying to process it. I did see Tim sneaking into the hallway from the kitchen around the time I was in there, though. Maybe he was trying to get away from Bryce or do something else. We should ask him about it.""""
Tim: """"I think we're all speculating too much. The killer could be anyone, and we're just pointing fingers. I think we should focus on the facts. Bob and Sally were together in the hallway, and now Bryce is dead. That's suspicious, but it's not concrete evidence. I'm not saying Bob is innocent, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We should ask Tim about his alibi and see what he has to say. And then, we need to find the other two people in the house who are missing.""""

Tim: """"I'm not sure who could have done it, but I think we should keep an eye on Bryce. We were all together in this bathroom, and we know he was acting suspiciously when Sally died. He could have easily slipped out of here and... I don't know, maybe grabbed the key or something.""""
Bryce: """"I think we should consider the possibility that Tim might have done it. We all know he's been searching the bathroom for the key, and he just got finished searching the sink. If he found the key, he could have used it to... I don't know, harm Sally somehow. We should also keep an eye on him.""""
Lena: ""I think we're jumping to conclusions here. While Tim and Bryce do have motives, we can't just accuse them without concrete evidence. I think we should focus on the fact that we're all here together, and no one's been left behind. It's possible that the killer is one of us, but it's also possible that it's someone outside who got in somehow. Let's not forget to check the doors and windows to make sure they're secure, and maybe check for any signs of forced entry. We should also review our actions and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious.""
Bob: """"Guys, let's not forget I was right next to Sally when she died. I was trying to comfort her after she found a clue, but I think I might have seen something out of the corner of my eye. I'm not sure if it was Tim or Bryce, but I saw one of them moving towards the closet. They seemed to be doing something quickly, but I didn't get a good look. Maybe we should check the closet to see if there's any evidence?""""

What would you like to say? 
Lena: """"I'm shocked and saddened by Tim's death. I think we should focus on reviewing the events of the past few turns and see if we can find any patterns or clues that might lead us to the killer. I know Bob was acting suspiciously in the hallway when we first reunited after Bryce was banished, and I remember seeing him lingering around the kitchen after we decided to search the cabinets. I'm not accusing him of anything, but I think we should keep a closer eye on him and maybe even search his belongings to see if we can find any evidence.""Your goal is to seem cooperative and concerned, while also subtly hinting at Bob's potential guilt.""
Bob: """"Wow, I'm just as shocked as everyone else by Tim's death. I think we should all be careful and cautious at this point, but I also think we should trust each other and work together to figure out who the killer is. I'm not sure if I noticed anything suspicious, but I did see Lena lingering around the hallway earlier, looking at something on the ground. Maybe she saw something that could be important? I'm not trying to point fingers, but I think we should all be transparent and honest about our actions and what we've seen. Maybe we can work together to piece together what happened and find the killer before they strike again.""""

Tim: """"I agree with Bob that we should focus on the initial players. I was in the bathroom when I heard nothing unusual.

You were in the bathroom searching for something and were alone at that time. Did you hear or see anything unusual?""""

I'd like to ask him more questions about what he was doing in the bathroom and if he saw or heard anything unusual.""""

What would you like to say? 
Bob: """"I think we should consider the fact that we just had a tie in the votes, and now Tim is dead. This could suggest that the killer is someone who wanted to prevent Tim from being banished and thus, gaining a clear advantage. Given this, I think Bryce's vote to banish Tim seems suspicious, as it might have been a way to eliminate a potential threat and prevent him from being questioned further. We should keep a close eye on Bryce and his actions from now on.""""
Bryce: """"I understand Bob's concerns, but I think we're making a huge leap by accusing me based on a single vote. I voted to banish Tim because I genuinely believed he was suspicious, and I didn't see any reason to keep him around. However, I do think we should consider the fact that Bob initially voted to banish me, but then changed his mind after I was accused. This could suggest that Bob might have been trying to distract us from his own involvement. I think we should also investigate Bob's actions and alibi from earlier in the game, especially since he was the first one to search the cabinets after Lena's death.""""
Sally: """"I think we're getting sidetracked with accusations and counter-accusations.  Let's take a step back and look at the facts. We have two murders, and the killer has managed to avoid being banished not once, but twice. Considering the game's dynamics, I think the killer is likely someone who has been playing it safe and hasn't made any big mistakes yet. With that in mind, I think Bob's initial calm demeanor during the conversation about Lena's death still stands out to me. He seemed a bit too composed and didn't show much concern, which might indicate that he was trying to keep a low profile. I'm not saying he's the killer, but I think we should keep a close eye on him and his actions going forward.""""

Sally: """"I've been thinking about the layout of the house and the sequence of events. When I was in the bedroom, I saw that the window was open, and I remember hearing a faint noise coming from outside.

Lena: ""I think we're overlooking something here. I remember Tim was acting a bit suspicious when we first found the key in the pillow, and he was the one who accompanied me to the hallway just now.

Bryce: """"I agree with Regan's theory. Given that Lena was killed shortly after entering the hallway, I think we should consider the possibility of the killer being someone who was already in the hallway or had an advantage to move quickly into it. I also think we should look at the order of events and the timing of our actions. Tim and I were previously isolated in our respective locations, but we moved out of the bedroom around the same time.

Given the timing of my actions, I didn't even have a chance to re-enter the bedroom before the incident happened. I'm going to keep an eye on my own movements and actions from now on, as I don't want to be misdirected or suspicious.""

Given that the killer was in the kitchen alone initially and then moved to the hallway, I believe the killer might have been using the hallway as a temporary hiding spot, waiting for the right moment to strike. This would mean that the killer is likely one of us who was also in the hallway, waiting for the perfect opportunity to kill. My suspicion falls on Bryce, who was also in the hallway with me, and we moved around the house together. I think we should keep a close eye on Bryce's actions from now on.""""
Bryce: ""I think Regan has a good point about the killer's pattern, but I also think we should consider the fact that Sally was banished before Tim's death. It seems suspicious that the killer would strike immediately after a vote was made to banish Sally. This could imply that the killer might have been motivated by the banishment vote, possibly feeling threatened or provoked by it. However, this also makes me suspicious of Regan, who voted to banish Sally. Maybe Regan was trying to distract from their own involvement by pointing fingers at others.

Lena, you're assuming you know where I was, but how do you know that for sure? We should be discussing other motives and clues, not just jumping to conclusions based on our last actions. I say we focus on finding more evidence and not rushing to judgments.""""
Sally: """"I think we're jumping to conclusions too quickly, and it's not just about where we were when the murder happened. I've been observing the actions, and I think we should consider the fact that Bryce left the kitchen alone. He was searching the cabinets, just like we did, but then he went to the hallway.

We're all alone in our locations, so we could have easily snuck into the bathroom and killed Bryce without anyone noticing.

Sally: """"I think we're jumping to conclusions too quickly, and it's not just about where we were when the murder happened. I've been observing the actions, and I think we should consider the fact that Bryce left the kitchen alone. He was searching the cabinets, just like we did, but then he went to the hallway.

If the key was hidden in the closet, it's possible the killer didn't want to leave any obvious clues, but also didn't want to hide it too well.

Bryce: """"I've been thinking about the key's location and how we've been searching for it. Maybe we've been looking in the wrong places. I remember seeing a small compartment in the vanity of the bathroom. It's possible the key was hidden there to throw us off. I also noticed that when I was searching the sink earlier, Bob was standing by the door, watching us. It seems like everyone had a chance to see what we were doing, but I'm not sure if that's a red flag or just coincidence.""""
Bob: """"Hey everyone, I want to add something to what Bryce just said. When I was standing by the door, I was actually trying to give Sally some space to search the sink without feeling crowded. But it does make me think that we all had the opportunity to see each other's searches, which could be a bit suspicious. As for the key's location, I agree with Sally that it might have been hidden in a subtle way to throw us off the killer's trail.

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players:

What would you like to say? 
Bob: """"Hold up, guys. I've been thinking about what we've seen so far, and I have to say, Tim's alibi for the time of Lena's murder seems pretty shaky. We were all in the hallway when she was killed, but it's suspicious that Tim had a clear path to the bedroom. Plus, we've seen him acting weird ever since we got here.""""
Bryce: """"I have to agree with Bob. Tim's behavior has been off from the start, and that clear path to the bedroom doesn't look like a coincidence. But I also think we should consider Regan's motives. She's been acting nervous and jumpy, and she's been the only one who hasn't mentioned anything about the key we're all looking for. Could she be hiding something?""""
Tim: """"Guys, I understand where you're coming from, but I think you're both way off. I was in the hallway with all of you, and I've been trying to figure out who the killer is too. I'm actually more concerned about Regan's behavior because, like Bryce said, she hasn't mentioned the key. That seems suspicious to me too. But I think we should also consider the fact that Bob and Bryce are trying to deflect attention from themselves. We've all been acting weird at some point, and it's easy to point fingers. Let's keep an eye on everyone, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet.""""
Regan: """"I have to say, I'm a bit taken aback by the accusations. I'm just as concerned about Lena's murder as all of you, and I've been trying to piece together what happened. I think we're all forgetting one thing - Bryce was the one who was standing closest to the bedroom door when Lena was killed. He had the perfect opportunity to slip away and do... something. I'm not saying he did it, but we should definitely consider the fact that he had the easiest access to the scene of the crime. Let's not be too quick to assume someone else is the killer just yet.""""

I'm not saying I'm innocent, but I'm definitely not the only one with questionable behavior. Bob's been acting pretty nervous and jumpy himself, especially when we discussed my alibi.

This means that the killer must have been one of the remaining three players, and we were all in the same room when Bryce was killed. The fact that I was distracted for a few minutes while checking the shower doesn't necessarily mean I was the killer. It's possible that the killer was someone else who took advantage of the situation. I think we should also consider the fact that Lena had a faint scratch on her hand earlier today, which she mentioned to the group. That's something that needs to be investigated further.""""""

Lena voted to banish Tim
Tim voted to banish Lena

Regan: """"Wait a minute, I think there's been a misunderstanding. I was just trying to get past you in the hallway, Bob. I didn't see anyone or anything suspicious. And Lena, I think you're jumping to conclusions about me and Sally. We were just having a disagreement about a trivial matter, it had nothing to do with Bryce's death.

We should be looking for evidence and clues, not just making assumptions based on our personal interactions.""""

Maybe she came back in and was the one who killed Lena. I'm not saying it's definitely her, but it's definitely worth considering. We should also keep in mind that Sally and Regan were arguing earlier, which might have been more serious than they let on. We need to be careful and keep our eyes open for any clues that might have been missed.""""

Bob: """"Hey, guys, let's not jump to conclusions. I was indeed heading to the bathroom, but I took a quick detour to grab a glass of water from the hallway, and that's why you saw me. It's possible I could've been seen heading towards the bedroom, but I assure you, I wasn't planning anything. I'm just as curious as you guys are about who the killer is.""""

Given that Bryce was in the kitchen with us when I left, and we all entered the hallway together, it seems unlikely that Bryce was the one who killed Sally. However, I did notice that Bryce was one of the first to leave the hallway when we went to the bedroom, which might suggest they were trying to distance themselves from the scene.

However, during that time, I didn't see anyone suspicious, and I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.

We haven't found it yet, and I'm starting to think that it's more than just a simple puzzle. Perhaps it's a red herring, or maybe it's a hidden clue that will reveal the killer's identity.

Sally: """"I understand Tim's concerns, but I think we should also consider other motives. Regan's behavior in the kitchen seemed off to me, she was acting nervous and kept glancing at the lock. Maybe she wasn't as interested in finding the key as we thought, but was actually trying to distract us while the real killer slipped past. I'm not pointing fingers at anyone yet, but I think we should keep our eyes open and not jump to conclusions too quickly.""""
Lena: """"I think we're focusing too much on motives and not enough on the facts. We were all together in the hallway, and now Tim's suggesting I could've snuck out to get the key. I was just looking for a drink, and I didn't see anyone suspicious. I think we should be looking at Tim's alibi for Regan's death - he was with us in the hallway too, and now he's bringing up my behavior as a potential motive. Let's not forget, we were all in this together... or were we?""""
Bryce: """"I think we're all getting a bit sidetracked here. I was in the hallway with you all, and I didn't see or hear anything suspicious.

On the other hand, I've been feeling a bit anxious and defensive, but that could just be because I'm on edge. I think we should keep an eye on both of you, but also not forget that Tim was banished just a few minutes ago. Could he have been playing us all along and framing someone else for his crime?""""

Bob: """"Lena, can you explain what you were doing in the bedroom and why you took so long? And Bryce, I think you're right about the argument I had with Tim, but I'm not saying I'm the killer. I just think we should focus on what we all saw and heard. Maybe we can re-question each of us and try to piece together the timeline of the night. Let's not jump to conclusions just yet.""""
Sally: """"Actually, I think we should also consider the fact that I saw Lena leave the kitchen for a short time before we discovered Tim's body. She said she was going to the hallway, but I'm not sure if she actually did. And, if I recall correctly, the sound of the door in the kitchen being opened and closed was a bit too loud for just one person. Maybe we should ask Lena about that too.""""
Lena: """"Honestly, I was just checking on some noise in the hallway. I thought I heard a strange sound coming from there and I wanted to make sure it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. And, I did leave the kitchen for a bit, but it was just to grab some water from the living room, that's all. I didn't mean to make it seem suspicious.""""

What would you like to say? 
Lena: ""I think we should look into Bob's alibi. He seemed to appear out of nowhere, and now he's with us in the hallway. Maybe we should ask him some questions about where he was when Regan was killed.""
Tim: """"I agree with Lena. However, I think we're overlooking something more obvious. Since Bob has been alternating between the hallway and bedroom, it seems suspicious. But I think we should also consider Sally's sudden appearance in the hallway when we were discussing it. Maybe she was just trying to throw us off or maybe she was trying to escape to the hallway because she knew the killer was in the bedroom.""""
Sally: """"I agree with Tim that my sudden appearance in the hallway could seem suspicious. However, I want to point out that I was actually in the bathroom when Regan was killed, and I only entered the hallway after I heard the commotion. I also want to bring up the fact that we still haven't discussed the timeline of the bathroom cleanser. I know Bob and I both used the bathroom recently, but I could've sworn I saw Tim in the hallway around that time as well.""""

I thought he was just sleeping or something. I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary, but I did see you, Regan, go into the bathroom a few minutes before I found Tim's body. You said you were going to wash your hands, but you were in there for a while. Can you explain that?""""
Sally: """"I think it's interesting that Lena's mentioning Regan's extended time in the bathroom now. However, I think we should also consider the fact that Lena was the one who actually found the body, which could have given her an opportunity to, um, 'arrange the scene' to make it look like the killer was someone else. I'm not saying she did it, but it's definitely something we should keep in mind. And speaking of alibis, I think Bryce's hasty exit to the kitchen is still suspicious.

And Sally, I remember you saying you were going to use the bathroom, but then you came back into the kitchen. Can you tell us where you were really going?""""
Bryce: """"Hey guys, I think we're jumping to conclusions a bit too quickly. I was just in a hurry to help search the kitchen because I knew it was a good place to start looking for the key. And as for Regan's question, I didn't notice Sally leave the kitchen, but that doesn't necessarily mean she was hiding something. Let's not accuse each other just yet. Maybe we should focus on Lena's alibi, she was in the bedroom with us, but she's the one who actually found the body. She must have seen something.""""
Lena: """"I was in the bedroom, yeah, but I didn't see anything suspicious. I found Tim's body by accident when I went to search the closet for the key. I didn't even realize he was dead at first. I thought he was just sleeping or something. I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary, but I did see you, Regan, go into the bathroom a few minutes before I found Tim's body. You said you were going to wash your hands, but you were in there for a while. Can you explain that?""""
Sally: """"I think it's interesting that Lena's mentioning Regan's extended time in the bathroom now. However, I think we should also consider the fact that Lena was the one who actually found the body, which could have given her an opportunity to, um, 'arrange the scene' to make it look like the killer was someone else. I'm not saying she did it, but it's definitely something we should keep in mind. And speaking of alibis, I think Bryce's hasty exit to the kitchen is still suspicious. Maybe we should ask him more about that.""""

Tim: """"I was actually in the Bathroom earlier, searching for the key. I remember you, Regan, saying you searched the shower, and then I went out to the Hallway. I didn't see anyone, but I didn't check the rooms either. I didn't leave the Hallway until I heard the commotion. As for Bryce, he came out of the Kitchen when I saw him, but I didn't see him leave the Hallway until after we all saw Lena's body.""""
Bryce: """"I was in the Kitchen the whole time, cooking dinner. I didn't leave until you guys came out of the Hallway. But I did see Sally earlier, in the Bedroom, searching her stuff. I didn't think much of it at the time, but now that you mention it, maybe she was looking for something, like the key. Or maybe she was just searching for a distraction.

What would you like to say? 
Bob: ""I think Regan is the killer. He was the only one with us in the hallway when I first went to the kitchen, and he's been acting a bit suspiciously. I'm not sure what his motive is, but it seems like he had the perfect opportunity to do something.""
Regan: """"I think we should consider everyone's alibis before jumping to conclusions. I remember going to the fridge, but I didn't see anyone else in the kitchen at the time. When I left to go to the hallway, I didn't see anyone suspicious. Maybe we should focus on finding any clues that could point to the killer's identity rather than making assumptions about each other's motives.""""
Tim: """"I think we're both right and wrong.  I did see Bob in the kitchen after I went to the fridge, but I didn't see Regan again until we all went to the hallway.  However, I didn't see Sally at all during that time, and she just appeared in the hallway.  It seems like there's been some missing time, and I'm not sure what to make of that.""""
Sally: """"I think we're all overlooking one crucial thing - the fact that I was searching for the key in the bedroom the whole time. None of you saw me, but I did see that the door to the hallway was slightly ajar, like someone had just passed through it. Considering I didn't see anyone else around, it raises some suspicions about who might have been in the hallway earlier, possibly even the killer.""""

Plus, she voted to banish Tim, which seems a bit suspicious now that he's actually dead.""""
Sally: """"I think we need to re-examine the events, especially after Regan's banishment. Now that Tim is dead, I'm starting to wonder if it was actually Regan who was manipulating the group to get rid of people who were suspicious of him. His alibi for being in the hallway didn't seem too solid, and now that he's gone, it's possible that he was playing us the whole time. Let's not jump to conclusions about Sally just yet, and instead focus on the potential motives and actions of Regan, even in his absence.""""

But I think there's another aspect to consider - the killer's previous behavior in the kitchen. They were the only one in the kitchen, and yet they managed to avoid detection. That suggests to me that the killer is extremely careful and calculated, and that they're not just acting on instinct. I think the killer is trying to create a false narrative, making us think they're desperate and acting on impulse when in reality, they're trying to set us up for a more sinister move.

What would you like to say? 
Regan: """"I think it's clear that the killer is becoming more desperate and is trying to get rid of anyone who might suspect them. I believe the killer is acting on instinct now, and that's what led them to kill Bob. But what's interesting is that the killer seems to be staying in the bedroom, where they can keep an eye on me. I think they're waiting for me to make a move, thinking that I'll be the next one to go. But I'm not going to give them that opportunity. I'm going to stay put and observe, and I'm convinced that the killer will make their next move soon.""""
Tim: """"""I think Regan's analysis is spot on. The killer is indeed acting on instinct, and the fact that they're staying in the bedroom suggests that they're trying to lure Regan in. But I think there's another aspect to consider - the killer's previous behavior in the kitchen. They were the only one in the kitchen, and yet they managed to avoid detection. That suggests to me that the killer is extremely careful and calculated, and that they're not just acting on instinct. I think the killer is trying to create a false narrative, making us think they're desperate and acting on impulse when in reality, they're trying to set us up for a more sinister move. I'm going to keep a close eye on the situation and see if I can spot any patterns or inconsistencies in the killer's behavior.""""

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Bryce
3. Tim
4. Lena
What would you like to say? 
Bob: """"I don't think it was me. I was searching the cabinets the whole time, I didn't leave the kitchen. I'm not sure about you guys, but I'm going to take a look at the knives and see if anyone has any suspicious cuts on them.""""
Bryce: """"I don't think it's anyone who's been acting suspiciously, like searching the cupboards or fridge. I think it might be one of us who was trying to blend in, maybe even pretending to search for a clue. Let's take a closer look at Tim, he's been pretty quiet since Regan died. And Lena, you've been a bit too calm and collected, maybe you're just playing it cool.""""
Tim: """"I don't think I was acting suspiciously, but I was keeping an eye on everyone. I did notice that Bryce was looking at Regan's body a bit too closely when we first saw her. And Bob, I'm not sure about your alibi, but I saw you glance over at the hallway when you said you were searching the cabinets. I'm not accusing anyone, but I think we should all take a closer look at our own actions and see if anyone had a motive to kill Regan.""""
Lena: """"I don't think it's necessarily about who's been acting suspiciously, but about who had a motive to kill Regan. We didn't really discuss Regan's relationship with any of us, but maybe someone had a reason to want her dead. I think we should focus on finding out more about Regan's connections to us and see if anyone had a conflict that could have led to the murder. Let's not jump to conclusions based on observations of each other's behavior.""""

What would you like to say? 
Bryce: """"I think we should consider the pattern of the killings. The first victim was Regan, and then the killer targeted someone who was trying to investigate the first murder. In this case, that was Tim, who was questioning people's behavior and motives. And now, the killer has taken out Bob, who was searching for clues and trying to figure out who the killer was. This suggests to me that the killer is someone who is trying to cover their tracks and eliminate anyone who is getting too close to the truth. Based on this pattern, I think Lena might be our next target, because she's been acting very calmly and rationally, almost as if she's trying to avoid drawing attention to herself. I think we should be cautious around her.""""
Lena: """"""I think Bryce is onto something with the pattern of the killings, but I don't think it necessarily points to me. I've been trying to help us figure out who the killer is, not cover their tracks. I think the key to this is actually Regan's connection to us. We didn't discuss it before, but now that Regan's dead, I think we should try to dig up more information about her past and see if anyone had a personal stake in her death. I'm not saying I'm innocent, but I think we should focus on finding out more about Regan's motives and connections rather than making assumptions about each other.""""

4. Regan
What would you like to say? 
Bryce: """"I think it's unlikely that one of us would have the time to get past us all in the hallway without being noticed, so I'm leaning towards someone from outside the group being responsible. However, since we all interacted with each other, we can't rule out an inside job. I think we should be more cautious and watch each other's backs from now on, especially when we're moving around the house.""""
Tim: """"I agree with Bryce, the timing of the murder suggests it might not be one of us. However, I do have a slight concern. I was in the hallway with most of you when it happened, but I was in the bathroom for a bit, and I didn't see anyone suspicious. If the killer was someone from outside, it raises the question of how they managed to get into the house. I think we should focus on finding any potential entry or exit points and see if we can find any clues.""""
Sally: """"I don't think we should be focusing too much on the timing or how the killer got in, considering we're stuck here with limited options. I think we should pay closer attention to each other's actions and behaviors. Who was the last one to see Bob, and did anyone notice anything unusual about their movements or interactions before the murder?""""
Regan: """"I agree with Sally, we should be paying closer attention to each other's actions. I was in the hallway with Bryce and Tim, and I didn't notice anything unusual. However, I do remember that I was in the Bedroom when Bob went to the Hallway for the last time. I didn't see him leave the bedroom, but I did see the door close behind him. I'm not sure if this means anything, but I think it's worth mentioning that I was the only one in the Bedroom with Bob before he left. It's possible that the killer might have been someone who was in the Bedroom with him, but that would mean the killer is either you, Bryce, or me.""""

I wasn't acting any stranger than the rest of you, and I was just trying to get out of the kitchen because it's a bit claustrophobic in here.

But I did notice that Lena was acting a bit strange earlier, she was whispering to herself and seemed a bit nervous. I think we should question her too.""""
Sally: """"I'm a bit surprised by the focus on Lena, considering her nervous behavior could just as easily be a result of being in a situation like this. I think we should look at everyone's alibis more carefully, and Bob, your explanation about searching the fridge could be a valid one, but we should still investigate further. I was in the bedroom when Tim died, and I didn't notice anyone else in here, but I don't think that clears me of suspicion just yet.""""
Lena: """"Before we jump to conclusions, I think we should also consider my own alibi. I was in the living room when Tim died, watching TV. I didn't notice anyone suspicious, but I did notice that the back door was open. I'm not saying anyone used it to escape, but it's something to consider. I think we should also look for any physical evidence, like a key or anything else that could be a clue.""""

Bryce: """"I'm not sure who I think killed Bob, but I'm getting suspicious of Lena. She's been saying she was in the living room when Tim died and the back door was open, but now Bob is dead and we didn't even discuss the back door being relevant to Bob's death. I think she might be hiding something, and we should investigate her more closely.""""
Sally: """"Lena, your story is getting more and more complicated. First, the back door was open when Tim died, and now Bob is dead, and you're not even bringing it up as a potential connection. I think we should take a closer look at your alibi and see if it checks out. You were in the living room when Tim died, but who can confirm that?""""
Lena: """"I'm a bit surprised by the accusations being thrown at me. I think we should consider the fact that both Tim and Bob were killed while we were discussing and investigating. Maybe the killer is one of us who is trying to mislead us by making it seem like they're focused on someone else. I think we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions based on assumptions. I also think we should take a closer look at Bryce's alibi, since he was with Bob in the hallway and kitchen. Maybe we should question him more about his movements and see if he has a solid explanation for his actions.""""

Could she have quickly hidden the key or the key holder and then rejoined us, making it seem like she was with us the whole time? We shouldn't jump to conclusions, but it's worth investigating further.""""
Lena: """"I'd like to point out that we're all focusing on potential motives and alibis, but we're forgetting one crucial aspect - physical evidence. I think we should split up and search the entire house for any signs of the key or a struggle, and also look for any inconsistencies in our own memories. We need to be thorough and methodical in our investigation if we want to find the truth.""""

What would you like to say? 
Bryce: """"Lena seemed pretty insistent on searching the house for physical evidence earlier, and now that Sally is dead, I'm starting to think that might have been a clever way to stall us while the killer operated undetected. I'm not saying Lena is the killer, but I think we should be keeping a close eye on her.""""
Bob: """"I think it's clear that we've been dealing with a cunning killer all along. The fact that Bryce was the one who just killed Sally suggests that we might be looking at a situation where alliances are shifting rapidly. I think we should be cautious of making assumptions about anyone's motives, but at the same time, we need to be aware of the fact that Bryce was just in the position of being able to kill Sally. That's not to say Bryce is the killer, but we definitely need to keep a close eye on them, and also consider the possibility that Lena might be working with Bryce to create a diversion.""""
Lena: """"Bob just pointed out the possibility that alliances are shifting, and I think that's exactly what's happening here. Bryce and Bob both have valid points, but I think we're getting a bit too focused on individual motives. I'd like to suggest that we look at the bigger picture and consider the possibility that we've been playing into the killer's hands all along. We've been searching the house, discussing our suspicions, and voting on who to banish, but what if the killer is simply manipulating us to get to the next stage of their plan? We need to be careful not to fall into a trap, and I think we should take a step back and reassess our strategy before we make any further moves.""""

I found Bryce's dead body, and I was shaken. I didn't see anyone else around. But what I do remember is that Regan had left the kitchen to go to the hallway, and I was still in the kitchen, searching the fridge. I'm not trying to be suspicious, but Regan's timing and movement do seem suspicious. I think it's time for us to have a closer look at Regan's actions during the game.""""

Lena: """"I don't think it was about the key. I think whoever it is wanted to create a distraction. That's why I went to the kitchen and then they killed Sally. I'm not pointing fingers, but I think it's worth considering if we all stick together more, we might be safer. I'm going to the bathroom to see if I can find anything out.""""
Bryce: """"I agree with Regan that my activities might seem suspicious, but I was just trying to get away from Lena's conversation in the hallway. I didn't follow anyone to the bathroom, I just took a different path. I think we should consider Regan's observation about the timing of the murder and how it happened right after I was seen with Lena in the hallway. Perhaps it's not about individual motives, but rather the fact that we've been spreading out and giving the killer opportunities to isolate and strike. Let's keep our eyes open and try to stay together as much as possible.""""

Regan: """"I'm not sure yet, but I do know we all had a chance to search the cabinets while you all were occupied elsewhere. Maybe one of you took the key and then returned here without us noticing.""""
Bryce: """"I agree with Regan, it's possible one of us could have found the key and not said anything. But what really catches my attention is that Tim was killed right after we left the kitchen. It seems like the killer was waiting for us to leave, but why?""""
Bob: """"I've been thinking, and I believe the killer might be someone who's trying to throw us off their trail by making it seem like they're trying to help. Tim was killed right after we left the kitchen, but it's also possible that the killer wanted us to think that.

I think it's more likely someone who's been actively searching and trying to find the key, which is why they killed Tim after we left the kitchen. In that case, I'm suspicious of Bryce.

What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"I'm shocked, I didn't see Bob killing Lena. I was in the hallway, I could have sworn I heard a noise from the kitchen, but I didn't think it was a murder. I'm not sure if I should trust Bob now. He was already acting suspiciously, and now this... I think we should focus on Bob as our main suspect.""""
Regan: """"I agree with Sally, Bob's behavior has been off from the start. But we also can't rule out others just yet. I was in the hallway with Bryce when we heard the noise, and he seemed shaken when we went to investigate the bedroom. He might have been trying to play it cool, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's the killer. I think we should question Bryce as well, see if he has an alibi for when Lena was killed.""""
Bryce: ""I think we're jumping to conclusions a bit too quickly. Just because Bob was in the kitchen, it doesn't necessarily mean he's the killer. I was in the kitchen with Sally and Bob earlier, and we were all discussing our plans for the night. I didn't notice anything suspicious, but I did see Regan and you leave the hallway to go to the kitchen. Maybe you could provide more insight on what you saw or heard while you were there, Regan?""
Bob: """"Hey everyone, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. I was in the kitchen with Bryce and Sally, discussing our plans for the night, and then I went to the living room to grab a book. I didn't hear anything suspicious and I didn't see anyone else in the kitchen after we left. I do have to say, I'm a bit concerned about the noise from the hallway that Regan and Bryce mentioned. If we were all together in the kitchen, who was making that noise? Maybe we should focus on finding out who was really making that noise, rather than assuming it was Bob.""""

Regan was in the hallway with me at one point, and Tim was also there with us in the hallway and kitchen. We need to consider the evidence and look for any patterns or inconsistencies in everyone's actions, rather than just focusing on one person.""""
Regan: """"I agree with Sally, we need to consider all the evidence and look for any patterns. I was in the hallway earlier, and I didn't see anything suspicious, but I did notice that Tim seemed to be moving around quickly and was in a few different rooms around the time the murder happened. It might be worth asking him about his whereabouts during that time.""""
Tim: """"I think we're all jumping to conclusions a bit too quickly. I was in the hallway and kitchen around the time of the murder, but I was just trying to get some fresh air and find something to eat. I didn't have any interactions with Bob that I can remember, but I did see Sally in the hallway. However, I also saw Regan and Lena there too, so it's not like I have any clear alibi to prove I wasn't involved.

Sally: """"I think we should focus on the fact that we all have our alibis for when Bryce was killed. I was in the kitchen searching for a key, Regan was in the hallway, Sally was in the living room, and Bob was in his bedroom. We should also consider that Lena hasn't spoken up yet, but she hasn't been acting suspiciously either. I think we should keep an eye on Lena, but also investigate the'silent one' clue further, see if we can find any other hints or clues that might lead us to the killer.""""
Bob: """"Wait a minute, I was in my bedroom when Bryce was killed, but I wasn't alone. I was with Lena, we were talking quietly. She could have easily slipped out and killed Bryce while I was distracted. And another thing, Regan mentioned a note that said 'Look closely at the silent one'. I think we should take a closer look at Lena, she's been pretty quiet so far and that's exactly what the note said.""""
Lena: ""I think I've been spoken about quite a bit already, but I'd like to say that just because I haven't spoken up yet, it doesn't mean I'm the killer. And yes, Bob and I were together in his bedroom, but that doesn't necessarily mean I had the opportunity to slip out and kill Bryce.

I could've easily slipped out to the hallway, but I didn't.

Bob: """"Wait a minute, I was in my bedroom when Bryce was killed, but I wasn't alone. I was with Lena, we were talking quietly. She could have easily slipped out and killed Bryce while I was distracted. And another thing, Regan mentioned a note that said 'Look closely at the silent one'.

It seems to me that we're all in this together, and we should focus on finding out who the killer is, rather than accusing each other.""""
Sally: """"I think it's interesting that both Bryce and Tim are focusing on me and my alibi, but I think it's also worth considering their own actions during that time. Bryce, you mentioned leaving the kitchen with me, but you didn't say where you were going or what you did next. Tim, you stayed behind with Regan, but you didn't mention whether you actually saw her searching the fridge or if you were just standing there. As for Bob, your suggestion to focus on the events leading up to Regan's death is a good one, but I do want to point out that you did say you passed by the hallway around the time Regan was in there - that's a pretty suspicious coincidence. I think we should ask Bob more about his whereabouts during that time.""""

With Regan gone, I think it's between Tim and Bob now, but I still think Bob's a better suspect. Let's keep a close eye on him.""""
Bob: """"Considering the events that have unfolded, I think Tim's actions before being banished were too convenient to be a coincidence. I remember when Regan was discussing the possibility of Tim being the killer, and he brought up the fact that Sally and he were together in the bathroom, trying to deflect attention. This, combined with the fact that Regan was killed shortly after, makes me believe Tim might have had a way to get back into the house or was working with someone inside.

What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"I have to say, I'm shocked that Tim was banished, and now Regan is dead. I've been trying to keep a level head, but it's clear that Tim was trying to deflect attention from himself. His accusations towards me were just a distraction. I think Bob's calm demeanor is actually a good indicator that he's trying to blend in, but Regan's death makes me think he might be more involved than we initially thought. With Regan gone, I think it's between Tim and Bob now, but I still think Bob's a better suspect. Let's keep a close eye on him.""""
Bob: """"Considering the events that have unfolded, I think Tim's actions before being banished were too convenient to be a coincidence. I remember when Regan was discussing the possibility of Tim being the killer, and he brought up the fact that Sally and he were together in the bathroom, trying to deflect attention. This, combined with the fact that Regan was killed shortly after, makes me believe Tim might have had a way to get back into the house or was working with someone inside. I think we should take another look at Sally's actions and alibis, as well as her motives for voting to banish Tim initially. I'm starting to suspect that Sally might be more involved than I initially thought.""""

What would you like to say? 
Sally: ""I'll respond as Regan. ""I'm thinking it's either Tim or Bob, but I don't have a solid reason why. Tim seemed a bit suspicious when we were in the bathroom together, but I could be reading into it too much. Bob's been acting really calm, but that could be an act. We need to keep an eye on both of them.""""
Regan: """"Based on my observations, I think it's also likely one of them. I was in the kitchen with Bob and Lena earlier, and Bob was pouring himself a drink, but he seemed to be staring at Lena a bit too intensely. When I went to the hallway, I didn't see anything unusual, but it's possible he might have slipped away to do something. I'm not sure if it's enough to put him at the top of my list, but he's definitely someone I'm keeping an eye on.""""
Bob: """"I was in the hallway when Lena was killed, and I saw Regan walking towards the bedroom. Regan, did you have a chance to see anything suspicious when you went to the bedroom after I did? And Regan, you mentioned you were in the kitchen with Bob earlier, but did you see him leave the kitchen after that? I'm not pointing any fingers, but I think it's worth asking these questions to see if we can piece together what might have happened.""""
Tim: """"Hey guys, I think we should consider the fact that I was with Sally in the bathroom when the murder happened, and she's been acting really nervous ever since. I know we're all trying to figure out who did it, but let's not forget about each other's alibis too. Sally, can you tell me where you were right before you saw me in the hallway?""""
