Tim: """"I think Lena has a good point about Bryce, but I'd like to point out that I was in the hallway with Lena and then went to the kitchen, so I don't think I can be ruled out entirely. However, I think I was one of the last people to interact with Regan when I was in the bathroom. I'm not sure if that's significant, but I do know that Sally was in the hallway with me earlier and then went to the kitchen around the same time I was searching the fridge. I think Sally's alibi might be shaky, and her lack of an alibi in the kitchen could make her a suspect.""""
Sally: """"I think I can clear up any suspicion on my part. I was in the hallway with Lena before Regan's murder, and we both saw each other. I also saw Regan arguing with Bryce earlier, and they seemed to have a history of conflict. Given what Lena and Tim have said, I think it's more likely that the killer is one of them, or possibly Bryce. But I do want to point out that I didn't see Tim entering the kitchen until after I had already searched the cabinets, so his alibi in the kitchen seems solid to me.""""
Bryce: """"I'd like to point out that, while Tim was in the kitchen, I was actually in the bedroom, alone, as per my previous movements. However, Sally mentioned seeing Regan arguing with me earlier, which might seem suspicious. But I'd like to clarify that Regan and I were just arguing about something unrelated to the game. It was a heated conversation, but it didn't escalate into anything physical. I think we should consider the possibility of an outsider being involved, rather than focusing solely on our in-game interactions. Given the tension between Regan and me, it's possible that someone took advantage of that to kill her.""""

What would you like to say? 
Sally: ""*Briefly and nonchalantly, trying to avoid raising suspicion*""I don't think it's fair to point fingers yet. We should consider all possibilities. I'm still trying to piece together what happened to Lena. Maybe we should focus on finding out how she ended up in the kitchen.""""
Bryce: """"*Cautiously, trying to maintain a neutral tone* I agree with Sally, we shouldn't jump to conclusions. However, I do think it's worth noting that Lena was found in the kitchen, and there was no sign of forced entry or struggle. It's possible that the killer might have been someone close to us. I'll take a closer look at my own interactions with Lena, just in case.""""

What would you like to say? 
Lena: """"I've been watching everyone's movements, and I think I can rule out Bryce - he seemed to be alone in the bedroom when I passed by, and he didn't enter the hallway with Tim. As for me, I was in the hallway with Sally before Regan's murder, but I don't think we had any reason to harm Regan. My main suspicion is on Tim, since he was in the hallway with me at one point, but I went to the bedroom and then he joined me in the hallway later. It's possible he might have been trying to throw us off his trail.""""
