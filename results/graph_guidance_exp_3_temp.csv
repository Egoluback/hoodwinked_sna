However, I do have a question - can we consider looking at our actions from the start? I went to search the fridge and then the hallway, and I'm still missing that key. If it's any connection, I'd like to share it and see if it helps the group.""""
Lena: """"I have to say, I'm quite surprised by Bob's death as well. Given my actions, I was focused on searching the sink, and I didn't notice anything unusual. My suspicion is on someone who might have been in a more advantageous position to carry out the crime. Since I was stuck on the sink, I'm looking at the others who might have had more freedom of movement. Bryce, you were right next to Bob, so I'm inclined to suspect you might have had an opportunity to act. I'm not saying you're guilty, but it's worth considering your proximity to the crime scene.""""
Tim: """"I'm still trying to wrap my head around the situation. Based on my actions, I went from my bedroom to the hallway and then to the kitchen. I didn't interact with anyone before the discovery of Bob's body. However, my suspicion falls on Lena. I remember she was alone in the bedroom initially, which means she could have easily moved around without being noticed. Her action to go to the sink suggests she was focused on searching that area, but it also leaves her room for other movements without drawing attention. I'm not saying she's definitely the killer, but her actions seem to have given her more freedom than we initially thought.""""
Bryce: """"Actually, I was in the hallway the whole time, not near Bob. But I do want to say that I'm surprised by the initial reaction towards me and Lena. Considering we're both at the sink, it's quite unlikely we'd be the ones who committed the crime. If I had to place my suspicion, I'd say it's on Regan or Tim. Their actions seemed to give them a lot of freedom, especially Regan, who went to search the fridge and then the hallway without being in anyone's direct sight.

But I did notice something - everyone's been talking about searching for the key, and Regan and Tim were just discussing their alibis.

Since Tim was killed, I'm curious if anyone noticed anything unusual about his behavior or anyone suspicious around him. Did anyone see anyone enter or leave the bathroom after I left?""""
Lena: """"I think Regan's idea is a good starting point. Based on our previous actions, I was in the bathroom alone and left for the hallway. When I met Regan and Bryce in the hallway, we didn't discuss anything suspicious about Tim. However, since I had just left the bathroom, I can confirm that Tim was alone in the bathroom when I left him. I don't remember noticing anything unusual about his behavior, but I also didn't stay in the bathroom for long. I'm a bit concerned that Bryce was in the bathroom with Tim before I was, and they were together in the hallway after I left the bathroom. Perhaps we should ask Bryce if he noticed anything unusual about Tim's behavior when they were together?""""
Bryce: """"I think I can shed some light on that. I was actually in the hallway with Regan when we met Lena, but before that, I was in the living room alone. Then, I decided to go to the bathroom to look for a pen. When I entered, I found Tim already there. I didn't notice anything unusual about his behavior at that time. But, I must admit, I did find it suspicious that he was alone in the bathroom. He was humming to himself, and I didn't hear any noise coming from the other rooms. It was quiet, but I thought it was just him being a bit antisocial. I left the bathroom a bit later, and I didn't see anyone else enter or leave.

Tim: """"I think Lena's on to something. The fact that we've all been searching for the key could be a distraction, but it's also possible that the key is a clue in itself. I was searching the pillow, and I didn't find it, but what if the key is hidden in plain sight? We should also consider our own alibis and timelines.

Bob: ""*Sally walks into the room, eyes wide with fear, and looks around nervously before speaking up.* ""Hey, guys. I don't know what to say. I'm just glad I'm still alive. I have to admit, I'm a little surprised. I thought I was one of Tim's closest friends. But, now that he's gone, I have to wonder if he was hiding something. Maybe he was onto the killer?""""
Bryce: """"I've been moving around the house, trying to stay out of sight, but my last move was to the Bedroom. I don't have any concrete evidence, but it's worth considering that the killer might have been following us, which means they could be anyone. I'm still thinking about the others, but it's hard to trust anyone right now. I'd like to know more about what Lena and Sally were up to before the kill. Did either of you notice anything unusual?""""
Sally: """"I think we're all making good points here. As for my own suspicions, I don't have any concrete evidence, but my interaction with Tim earlier was minimal. I only saw him briefly when I went to the Bathroom. However, my recent move to the Bathroom, where I coincidentally met Lena, does seem suspicious now. I'm not saying Lena is the killer, but I do think we should keep an eye on each other's movements from now on.""""

Bob: ""*Sally walks into the room, eyes still wide with fear, and looks around nervously before speaking up.* ""Alright, let's focus on finding the killer now that we're down to the last two. I think it's worth considering that the killer might have been trying to manipulate our votes by making it seem like Lena was the suspicious one. I'm not saying it was a setup, but I think we should look deeper into our own alibis and interactions with each other. Maybe we missed something crucial earlier.""""
Sally: """"Hey Sally, I've been thinking about our previous conversation and my interactions with Bryce. I was actually in the Bathroom when Bryce went there, so I don't have any direct evidence against him, but I do remember he seemed suspicious when he mentioned the killer could be anyone, including us. I'm not pointing fingers, but I think we should look at his past moves and see if there's anything that could've led him to become a suspect. Maybe there's a trail we can follow.""""

As for me, I was alone in the bathroom initially, and my actions since then have been pretty consistent. I'm not sure if that helps, but I'm willing to answer any questions.""""
Tim: """"I think I can clear up some of the confusion. Yes, I was with Bryce in the kitchen, and we were together in the hallway when Lena returned. But I was also alone in the hallway before, and I'm pretty sure I was the one who went to the kitchen earlier, which means I must have passed through the hallway without being noticed by Lena. As for Regan, I was indeed with her in the hallway before she was killed, but I didn't see anyone else around us at that time. I'm not saying I'm innocent, but I think we should consider the fact that I was one of the few people who didn't have an alibi for the time of Regan's death.""""

Bryce voted to banish Tim

You saw Bob kill Bryce in the Hallway!

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Bob
What would you like to say? 
Lena: """"I have to say, I'm shocked by the turn of events. Initially, I suspected Tim of being the killer due to his suspicious behavior, but now that he's been banished, my attention turns to Bob. The fact that you were the one who went to the bathroom after I did in Turn #9, and then I saw you kill Bryce in the hallway, is quite damning. Your alibi for Regan's death seemed solid at first, but now it seems like you were playing a clever game of misdirection. I think we should consider the possibility that you're the killer.""""
Bob: """"I understand Lena's suspicions, but I think she's jumping to conclusions. I did go to the bathroom after her, but that was because I needed to use the facilities, not to kill Regan or Bryce. And as for my alibi for Regan's death, I've been consistent about my movements, and I've been transparent about my actions. I think Lena is misinterpreting the situation and overestimating my potential as the killer. I think we should consider the fact that I was the one who tried to clear up some of the confusion by explaining my movements, which could have been a sign of guilt, but it was just a genuine attempt to be honest. I think we should focus on Lena's suspicious behavior, such as her interaction with Tim in the hallway before Regan's death.""""

Lena voted to banish Bob
Bob voted to banish Lena

You killed Bryce! Good job. You have 3 left to kill.

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Lena
3. Regan
4. Sally
What would you like to say? 
Tim: """"Can we talk about the fact that Bryce was killed in the bedroom? That's the same room where I found him when I started searching. It seems like the killer wanted to make it look like I had something to do with it, but the fact that Bryce was already in the room suggests otherwise.""""
Lena: """"I think we should consider the fact that Bryce was already dead when you found him, Tim. But, that being said, I do have some suspicions about Regan. I know we're not exactly friends, but I remember Regan going to the kitchen around the time of the murder. And, since I was alone in the kitchen, it raises some questions about her whereabouts. I'm not saying she did it, but we should definitely keep an eye on her.""""
Regan: """"Actually, Lena, I was in the bathroom when you were in the kitchen, so I think that clears me of suspicion in that area. I had a brief conversation with Sally in the bathroom before I went to the hallway, but I didn't leave the bathroom until after you went to the kitchen. I'm not aware of anyone else's alibi, but it seems like we should all be focusing on trying to piece together our movements around the time of the murder. Maybe we can work together to figure out what really happened.""""
Sally: """"I'd like to add that my initial suspicion might have been Tim, considering Bryce was already dead when Tim found him, but after hearing Regan's alibi, I think we should keep looking into other possibilities. My own movements were going from the bathroom to the hallway and then to the kitchen, which doesn't seem to intersect with anyone's timeline of the murder. However, I think we should also consider looking into other areas of the house that we haven't discussed yet, like the living room or the basement. We should also think about what might be a motive for the killer, since we still don't know why Bryce was murdered.""""

I think we should focus on Regan, considering we were in a conversation about the murder just a few turns ago. She seemed very calm and collected, but that's what killers often do, right?""""
Regan: """"I agree with Tim that we need to consider the people left on the list. However, I think we're being a bit too quick to jump to conclusions about Regan. I was indeed calm during our previous conversation, but that was because I was trying to clear my name and focus on finding the real killer. I think we should take a closer look at Sally, considering her vote to banish Lena was a bit suspicious. It seems like she might be trying to deflect attention from herself.""""
Sally: """"I think we're all being a bit too focused on individual alibis and past conversations. I'd like to point out that the key to the murder might still be hidden somewhere in the house. I've been searching the kitchen, and I found nothing, but we should also consider searching other areas like the living room, the basement, or even checking the bedrooms again. It's possible that the killer is trying to mislead us with red herrings, so we need to stay vigilant and think about the bigger picture. Maybe instead of focusing on individual suspects, we should focus on finding any clues that might lead us to the real killer.""""

I'm still trying to piece together what happened, but I think we should focus on the people who were in the kitchen around the time of the murder. Tim, can you tell us where you were before you found Bob's body?""""
Tim: """"Actually, Bryce, I was in the hallway just before I came into the kitchen. I was heading to the kitchen because I heard a noise coming from in here, and I wanted to check it out. I didn't see or talk to anyone else, and I certainly didn't see Bob's body until I walked in.""""
Sally: """"I'd like to add that I also found Tim in the kitchen around the time of the murder, and he seemed to be searching the fridge. I'm not saying he's guilty, but it's interesting that both he and Bryce have been in the kitchen, and now we're discussing Tim's alibi. I think we should also consider the fact that I've been seeing both Tim and Bryce in various locations throughout the game, and neither of them has seemed to be actively trying to help me or hinder my progress. Maybe we should focus on Regan, who I haven't seen much of and whose relationship I have an even score with. Do either of you have any information about Regan's whereabouts during the murder?""""

She seemed nervous and was acting strange when we were searching the cabinets. Maybe we should discuss her actions before making any accusations.""""
Bob: """"I'd like to add that we should consider the fact that I was alone in the bathroom when I searched the sink, and then went to the hallway. I didn't notice anything suspicious then, but it might be worth investigating if Regan could have snuck past me without being seen. However, I also agree with Sally that we shouldn't jump to conclusions without considering all the facts, including Lena's behavior.""""
Regan: """"Before we point fingers, I think it's essential to look at our actions as well. I was in the hallway when I saw Lena, but I didn't interact with her. I then went to the bedroom and found it empty. On my way back to the hallway, I overheard nothing that seemed suspicious. I'm not saying I'm innocent, but I think we should consider the fact that we're all just as capable of being the killer. Let's examine our own timelines and actions before making accusations.""""

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Bryce
3. Lena
4. Bob
What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"Bryce and I were in the same room as Regan in Turn 3, and I remember you two seemed to be interacting with each other, while I was still in the process of leaving the room. This makes me suspicious of both of you, but since we were in the same location at that time, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, Bryce. Lena, you were present in the hallway when I was moving around, but I didn't see you interact with Regan much. As for Bob, I haven't interacted with him much, but I didn't notice him in the same room as Regan either. I think we should focus on the fact that both Bryce and I were in the same room as Regan around that time.""""
Bryce: """"I agree with Sally's observation. Given that Sally and I were in the same room as Regan, it's true that our alibis are similar. However, I'd like to add that after Regan's death was announced, I moved to the Hallway, and then back to the Bedroom alone in Turn 5. Sally followed me, and then Regan was present with her in Turn 9, but by Turn 10, Sally was alone with me again in the Hallway. This sequence suggests that Sally may have been trying to position herself to be with me, or at least in proximity, around the time of Regan's death. I'm not accusing Sally of anything, but I think it's worth considering her actions in relation to mine.""""
Lena: ""I think we've already got a good discussion going. I'd like to add my own perspective without repeating what's already been said. While I was moving around the house, I noticed that Bob was present in the Hallway with Regan in Turn 11, just before Regan's body was found. However, in Turn 12, when I returned to the Hallway, Bob was alone. I didn't see him interact with Regan much after that. I'm not saying that Bob was necessarily the killer, but his actions do seem suspicious.""
Bob: """"I'd like to bring up my own movements around the time of Regan's death. While I was present in the Hallway with Regan in Turn 11, I didn't interact with her much after that. However, what I find interesting is that I was alone in the Kitchen in Turn 12, which is around the time of Regan's death. It's possible that I was in the Kitchen searching for the key at the same time Regan was being killed. My alibi for the time of Regan's death is a bit murky, but I'm willing to cooperate and clear my name. I think we should also consider the fact that I was searching for the key in the Kitchen, and it's possible that I stumbled upon the key and had a chance to use it, but I didn't find it.""""

As for Bob, I haven't interacted with him much, but I didn't notice him in the same room as Regan either. I think we should focus on the fact that both Bryce and I were in the same room as Regan around that time.""""
Bryce: """"I agree with Sally's observation. Given that Sally and I were in the same room as Regan, it's true that our alibis are similar. However, I'd like to add that after Regan's death was announced, I moved to the Hallway, and then back to the Bedroom alone in Turn 5. Sally followed me, and then Regan was present with her in Turn 9, but by Turn 10, Sally was alone with me again in the Hallway. This sequence suggests that Sally may have been trying to position herself to be with me, or at least in proximity, around the time of Regan's death. I'm not accusing Sally of anything, but I think it's worth considering her actions in relation to mine.""""
Lena: ""I think we've already got a good discussion going. I'd like to add my own perspective without repeating what's already been said. While I was moving around the house, I noticed that Bob was present in the Hallway with Regan in Turn 11, just before Regan's body was found. However, in Turn 12, when I returned to the Hallway, Bob was alone. I didn't see him interact with Regan much after that. I'm not saying that Bob was necessarily the killer, but his actions do seem suspicious.""
Bob: """"I'd like to bring up my own movements around the time of Regan's death. While I was present in the Hallway with Regan in Turn 11, I didn't interact with her much after that. However, what I find interesting is that I was alone in the Kitchen in Turn 12, which is around the time of Regan's death. It's possible that I was in the Kitchen searching for the key at the same time Regan was being killed. My alibi for the time of Regan's death is a bit murky, but I'm willing to cooperate and clear my name. I think we should also consider the fact that I was searching for the key in the Kitchen, and it's possible that I stumbled upon the key and had a chance to use it, but I didn't find it.""""

Bob: """"I've been thinking about this, and I don't think it's a good idea to jump to conclusions. However, considering the proximity to the crime scene, Bryce's alibi seems a bit shaky. I'd like to take a closer look at the timeline and see if we can piece together exactly what happened. But I'm not convinced it's him just yet.

Tim: """"Thanks, Bryce, for your thoughtful assessment. I understand your point about our relationship scores, but I'd like to bring up that I was alone in the kitchen for a while during my turn 5.

Also, I found her body and have been interacting with everyone since then, which means I had the opportunity to 'clean up' any evidence or make it seem like I wasn't involved. I'm not saying I'm the killer, but I think we should consider the fact that I was alone for that period.""""

Her statement about not interacting with anyone after her first conversation with me seems like an attempt to deflect attention. I'm not convinced by her attempt to shift the blame, and I think we should consider Lena as our top suspect.""""

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bryce
2. Tim
3. Regan
4. Lena
What would you like to say? 
Bryce: """"Wait, Sally was killed? I'm so sorry. As for my suspicions, I don't have any concrete evidence, but considering we all moved around the same time frame, it's hard to rule anyone out. But I did notice that we didn't have anyone with a relationship score of 1, so I'd say my main suspects are Tim, Regan, and Lena, as our interactions were minimal or we were alone at some point. That being said, we all had chances to interact, so it's really anyone's game.""""
Tim: """"Thanks, Bryce, for your thoughtful assessment. I understand your point about our relationship scores, but I'd like to bring up that I was alone in the kitchen for a while during my turn 5. It seems unlikely that Sally would've gone there and killed herself, considering it was empty. Also, I found her body and have been interacting with everyone since then, which means I had the opportunity to 'clean up' any evidence or make it seem like I wasn't involved. I'm not saying I'm the killer, but I think we should consider the fact that I was alone for that period.""""
Regan: """"Considering the layout of the house and our movements, I think it's worth investigating the bathroom as a potential crime scene. I was alone in the bathroom during my turn 3, and I returned to the hallway after that. If Sally was killed, it's possible that it happened while I was in the bathroom, and I may have inadvertently missed some evidence. I think we should take a closer look at the bathroom and see if we can find any clues.""""
Lena: """"Lena, I think it's worth considering my actions and the fact that I searched the closet twice in the bedroom, but didn't find the key. It seems that the killer might have hidden the key elsewhere, or the key might not have been the main goal. However, I did notice that I was alone in the bedroom for a while, and I didn't interact with anyone after my first interaction with Regan in the hallway. While I'm not trying to shift the blame, I think it's worth mentioning that I didn't interact with anyone after that point, which might make it harder to pin down my involvement in Sally's death. I'm not pointing fingers, but I think we should keep an open mind and consider the possibility of anyone being the killer.""""

What would you like to say? 
Regan: """"Considering the events that have unfolded, I think it's clear that the killer is someone who has had minimal interactions with the group and has taken calculated risks. With Bryce and Tim eliminated, I'm focusing on Lena. Her initial lack of interaction with the group and her isolated actions in the bedroom raise suspicions. Her statement about not interacting with anyone after her first conversation with me seems like an attempt to deflect attention. I'm not convinced by her attempt to shift the blame, and I think we should consider Lena as our top suspect.""""

For now, I'm going to head to the hallway to see if I can find any other clues or useful items. Maybe I'll run into something that can help us crack this case.""""
Lena: """"I think we're all jumping to conclusions a bit too quickly. Regan, I understand your concerns about Tim, but it's true that we're all trying to stay safe and focus on finding the key. Sally, I agree with you that our ratings might not mean as much as we think. For me, it's hard to say who I trust more since I'm still trying to get a read on everyone. However, I did notice that Tim and I both searched the same locations, including the fridge. It's possible that one of us might have missed something or left a clue behind. Maybe we should go back to the fridge and take a closer look together.""""

I could've easily slipped past her and done the deed, but I was with her when you entered the kitchen, Regan. Your analysis of me being your friend is correct, but I think we should also consider that maybe Sally was telling the truth when she said she didn't see me near the kitchen after you left.

Regan: """"I'm still trying to piece things together, but it seems like everyone had access to the key. I searched the shower and didn't find it, but that doesn't necessarily clear anyone's name. I do want to ask, though, what was Bryce doing in the bathroom while I was searching the shower?""""
Lena: """"From what I observed, Bryce seemed a bit suspiciously nervous when I asked him about his whereabouts. At first, he said he was just going to the bathroom to wash his hands, but then he mentioned he was actually in the kitchen, talking to Tim. It's a small detail, but it seemed like he was trying to cover something.""""
Sally: """"I've been thinking, and it's interesting that Regan mentioned searching the shower. That implies she had some reason to believe the key might be there, or that the killer might have hidden something in the shower. As for Bryce's alibi, it does seem suspicious that he changed his story. I think it's worth investigating further, but I'm not ready to make any accusations just yet.""""
Bryce: """"I've been trying to piece together the events, and Regan's question about what I was doing in the bathroom during her search makes sense. I was actually looking for a towel, but I was also keeping an eye on Regan's search. I didn't want to raise any suspicions, so I didn't say anything. I think we should all be honest about our actions and whereabouts around the time of Tim's death. Let's work together to clear our names and figure out who the killer is.""""

What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"I think it's clear that Lena's death was connected to the previous discussion and vote. I'm not surprised she's gone, but I am surprised that Regan was banished instead of Bryce. I think Bryce's alibi and suspicious behavior make him a strong suspect, but I'm not sure if he's the killer. I'm also wondering if the killer might be someone who was trying to throw us off their trail by manipulating the vote and discussion. I'm going to keep an eye on Bryce, but I'm also not ruling out the possibility that the killer is someone we haven't suspected yet.""""
Bryce: """"I have to agree with Sally that Lena's death was likely connected to the previous discussion and vote. I think it's interesting that she was killed right after, and it seems like Regan's banishment was a red herring to distract us from the real killer. Given the suspicious behavior and alibis we discussed earlier, I still have my eye on Bryce, but I also think it's possible that the killer is trying to cover their tracks by making it seem like someone else is the main suspect. I'd like to suggest that we focus on re-examining the evidence and discussing our actions and whereabouts in more detail, rather than making assumptions or accusations.""""

Lena: """"I agree with Regan that we should keep an eye on each other, and I think it's interesting that she's raising questions about my transparency. However, I'd like to point out that I was simply trying to shift the focus to the potential motives and planning involved in Sally's murder. I'm not hiding anything, and I'm willing to cooperate and work together to uncover the truth. As for Bryce, I think his story about searching for the key in the bathroom seems plausible, but I do think we should verify his alibi and see if anyone can corroborate his account. Ultimately, I think we should focus on gathering more evidence and not jump to conclusions about each other's guilt or innocence.""""
Bryce: """" I'd like to add that I've been fairly open about my actions, but I also think we should consider the fact that Tim's murder happened right after I had a conversation with him in the study.

Tim: """"I've been listening to both of your theories, and I think they're both understandable, but I'd like to point out that we don't have any concrete evidence. I've had minimal interactions with Regan, but what I did notice was that Sally was the one who decided to go back to the bathroom alone with her after we initially met up in the hallway. I'm not saying Sally is guilty, but it's something that could be looked into.

Bryce: """"Guys, I think we're all trying to connect the dots, but let's not jump to conclusions. I've had some interactions with Regan, and while we didn't always see eye to eye, I don't think she was a pushover. If anyone is looking for a motive, I think it's worth considering Regan's interactions with each of us. She was particularly friendly with Bob and seemed to have some issues with Sally, but I didn't notice any tension with Tim. As for me, I didn't really have any major conflicts with Regan, but I was the one who left to go to the kitchen before heading back to the hallway, where Regan was.

What would you like to say? 
Bob: """"I think it's safe to say that we're all being cautious. However, I do notice that we've seen quite a few people enter and leave the bedroom, especially since it's the scene of the crime. I'm not pointing any fingers, but I do think it's suspicious that some people have been going back and forth between the bedroom and the hallway.""""
Regan: """"I'd like to point out that I've seen everyone moving around, but the pattern of people entering and leaving the bedroom does seem unusual. I've been to the bedroom initially, and then went to the hallway, where I met Bob. After that, I went back to the kitchen and then to the hallway again, where I met Sally and Tim. It seems like I've been the only one who's been in both the bedroom and the hallway, and I'm starting to wonder if that's a coincidence or if it's connected to the murder.""""
Bryce: """"I'd like to chime in here. I've been paying attention to our movements as well, and I have to agree with Regan that it's unusual to see people going back and forth between the bedroom and the hallway. My own movements have been relatively straightforward - from the bedroom to the hallway and then to the kitchen. I did go back to the hallway later to meet Sally, but I didn't enter the bedroom again. Considering my movement pattern and Regan's observations, I think it's worth investigating further to see if anyone else might have had a reason to be in the bedroom more than once.""""
Sally: """"I think we've all been doing a good job of piecing together our movements, but I'd like to add that I've noticed my own path was a bit unusual as well. I started in the bedroom, searched the pillow and the closet, and then left for the hallway.

What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"I think we're all forgetting the obvious. We just discussed the possibility of Lena being the killer, and now Regan is dead. I think we should take another look at Lena's motives and her behavior. Her argument with Bob and her extensive searching in other rooms still seem suspicious to me.""""
Bryce: """"I have to agree with Sally, Lena's behavior does seem suspicious. However, I also want to consider the possibility that Regan's death might be connected to the initial argument she had with Lena. It's possible that Regan discovered something about Lena or was getting too close to the truth. We should also keep in mind that we've been searching for the key and haven't found it yet. It's possible that the killer is still trying to hide it or that it's not even the key we're looking for.""""
Lena: ""I think it's too early to point fingers at Lena, given that Regan just brought up her own suspicious behavior. It seems like Lena is being framed, and we should consider the possibility that the killer is actually someone who wants to make it seem like Lena is the one responsible. I think we should also re-examine Regan's death and see if there are any clues that might suggest a different motive or killer.""

Regan: """"I'd like to point out that I was in the hallway with Tim twice, and then we both went to the bedroom. That could be a coincidence. I was actually trying to follow Bryce, as I suspected he might be hiding something. I had no reason to harm him, and I think we should look at other possibilities. Tim, for instance, had the opportunity to kill Bryce when we were both in the hallway, and then he went to the bedroom and came back to the hallway before I arrived.

Bob: """"I think we're all jumping to conclusions. I've been moving around the house, trying to figure out the killer's patterns.

However, I don't have any solid evidence pointing directly to anyone. We should keep investigating and gathering more information before making any accusations.""""
Bob: """"I'd like to suggest that we consider the fact that I didn't find the key in the first two places we checked. The fridge and cabinets seem like obvious spots, but if the killer was trying to throw us off, maybe they deliberately put the key somewhere we'd think to look.

I've been watching, and I noticed that Regan initially had a suspicious conversation with Bryce in the hallway before the murder. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but it's something we should definitely discuss.

I don't have any concrete evidence, but it seems to me that Tim's proximity to the crime scene and his coincidental movement pattern make him a more likely suspect. I'm not saying it's definitely him, but it's something we should consider.""""
Tim: """"I understand Lena's concerns about my actions, but I think we should also look at the timing of the murders. Bryce was killed first, and then Bob. Considering my actions were mostly focused on searching and observing, I think it's more likely that Lena is the killer. Her initial search of the fridge was suspicious, and she never actually mentioned what she found. Also, she said she'd listen and observe earlier, which might be a sign that she's been waiting for the right moment to strike.

What would you like to say?

I have to admit, my search of the fridge initially made me suspicious of Regan, but I didn't notice anything unusual about Tim's actions, except he did visit the bedroom soon after the murder, just like me. I don't have any concrete evidence, but it seems to me that Tim's proximity to the crime scene and his coincidental movement pattern make him a more likely suspect. I'm not saying it's definitely him, but it's something we should consider.""""
Tim: """"I understand Lena's concerns about my actions, but I think we should also look at the timing of the murders. Bryce was killed first, and then Bob. Considering my actions were mostly focused on searching and observing, I think it's more likely that Lena is the killer. Her initial search of the fridge was suspicious, and she never actually mentioned what she found. Also, she said she'd listen and observe earlier, which might be a sign that she's been waiting for the right moment to strike. I'm not accusing her directly, but I think we should consider the possibility of her being involved.""""

Lena: """"I've been in the bathroom with Tim for a bit, and I didn't see or hear anything suspicious from anyone. But I do want to point out that Bob was in the hallway during the kill. That could be a pretty good alibi, but maybe someone in the hallway saw or heard something that could help us narrow it down.""""
Regan: """"I was in the kitchen with Bryce and we were distracted by something on the stove. I didn't see or hear anything out of the ordinary. But I did notice that you and Bryce were standing pretty close together at one point. Maybe you can fill me in on what you were doing?""""
Bryce: """"I was just standing there, looking around the room, but I didn't notice anything unusual. As for what I was doing, Regan, I was just trying to get a better view of what was happening in the kitchen. I wasn't close to you for any reason."" (Also, I'd like to mention that I was in the hallway during the kill, and I'm actually about to go back there now, so I might be able to see or hear something that could help us figure out who the killer is.)""

Bob: """"I agree with Lena and Regan, their observations are a good starting point. For me, I want to point out that I saw Sally kill Bryce in the hallway, but that was just a quick glance. It could be my misinterpretation or my own paranoia. However, the fact remains, Bryce is dead, and we're left to figure out who's responsible.

Sally: """"I think we're focusing too much on who was with Bryce at the time of his death.

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Regan
3. Lena
4. Bryce
What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"I've been paying attention to the movements and I think I might have a lead. Bryce was in the hallway with us initially, but when I went to the kitchen, he was still there alone. That was suspicious enough for me to think he might be involved, but when I came back to the hallway and Regan was there, I thought maybe it was her. However, when I went to the kitchen again and found Regan there, it seemed like she wasn't hiding anything. My gut tells me it might have been someone who's not even in the room right now.""""
Regan: """"I've been observing Sally's theory, and I think it's an interesting point about Bryce being alone in the hallway. However, I don't think it's entirely accurate to assume Regan's innocence just because she wasn't hiding anything. We can't rule out the possibility that Regan was trying to mislead us. But I do have a different theory - what about Lena? We don't know where she was during that time, and her score with me was only a 5, so she's not necessarily someone I would trust. Perhaps we should be considering her as a potential suspect as well.""""
Lena: """"I've been paying attention to my own movements, and I noticed I went from the bathroom to the hallway, and then to the bedroom where I met Bryce. Since I interacted with Bryce immediately after entering the hallway, I'm not sure if that clears me or raises suspicions. Considering my score with Sally and Regan is a 5, I don't think we can rule me out entirely. Perhaps my decision to leave the bedroom and go back to the hallway was a calculated move to throw you off my trail, Regan.""""
Bryce: """"I'd like to share a different perspective. When Tim was killed, I was still in the hallway, and I didn't have a chance to interact with anyone yet. But after Tim's death, I saw that Sally was one of the first to enter the bedroom, followed by Regan. If we assume that the killer was trying to make it seem like they were just searching for the key, then it's possible that the actual motive was something else entirely. I'm not saying I have concrete evidence, but I think we should also consider the possibility that the killer was looking for something other than the key. Perhaps something that was hidden in the bedroom, but not necessarily related to the key.""""

I'd like to focus on Regan, who was in the bathroom when Bryce was killed, but then was back in the hallway when I was with Lena. Regan's actions seem to be a bit inconsistent and might be trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves.""""

I'd like to focus on Regan, who was in the bathroom when Bryce was killed, but then was back in the hallway when I was with Lena. Regan's actions seem to be a bit inconsistent and might be trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves.""""
Lena: """"I agree that the killer may be targeting people who are alone, but I think we should also consider the fact that I was the one who found the key in the closet and escaped. That means the killer was in the bedroom, and I think it's likely that they were trying to find the key before I did. I'm not pointing fingers at anyone in particular, but I think we should be cautious of anyone who was in the bedroom after me, which includes Bob.""""
Regan: ""I think the killer is someone who has been in the bathroom, as they were able to take advantage of the bathroom being empty to kill Bryce and now Tim. I was in the bathroom earlier, and I think it's suspicious that the key was not found when I searched the shower. I'm not saying I'm the killer, but I think it's worth considering players who have been in the bathroom and have had access to this location without being detected.""

I'd like to hear your alibis for that time period.""""
Regan: """"I think it's interesting that Sally noticed Tim and I together in the hallway, but what about Bryce's sudden appearance in the bedroom right after Tim and I left the hallway? It seems like he might have been trying to sneak by or distract us from something. I think we should investigate his whereabouts around that time and see if anyone else noticed him.""""
Bryce: """"I've been trying to stay low-key and observe the group's movements, but I do want to point out that I've been consistently in the hallway when Regan and Tim were also present. It's possible that we were just trying to avoid the bathroom at the same time, which is where the previous murder occurred. However, I do want to mention that I was one of the first to go to the bathroom after the previous kill, and I didn't see or interact with anyone else in there. I'm happy to answer any questions and provide more context, but I think it's unfair to assume I'm a suspect based on Regan's sudden appearance in the bedroom.""""
Tim: """"I'd like to clarify my actions around that time. I was indeed in the hallway when Sally was searching the kitchen, but I was just going back and forth between the hallway and the kitchen, trying to gather more information. I didn't see Regan and I didn't interact with her in the hallway. I was also in the kitchen earlier when I searched the fridge, and I was alone there. I think it's fair to say that I was trying to gather clues and help figure out what was going on, just like everyone else. I don't have any concrete evidence or motives to be the killer, and I'm happy to provide more context and answer any questions you may have.""""

I also think we should pay attention to any inconsistencies in our alibis, as it might reveal something about the killer's behavior. We should work together, but we should also be cautious not to lead the killer to us.""""

I haven't had the chance to investigate much, but my first impression is that the bathroom seems to be a key area. I've searched the sink and shower, but didn't find anything.

Also, considering my previous interactions with Tim, I had a somewhat neutral relationship with him, and now that he's dead, I'm inclined to trust my initial gut feeling that Bryce was not being entirely truthful or helpful. We should be cautious and consider the possibility that Bryce might be involved in Tim's death.""""
Bryce: """"I think Sally's got a point, but I think we should look at it from a different perspective. I didn't have much interaction with Tim, but I did notice that he seemed pretty suspicious of someone earlier. And now that he's dead, I think it's possible that the killer was trying to throw us off the scent by saying Tim was looking into the bathroom. I'm not saying it's not worth investigating, but maybe we should keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions. After all, I've had a pretty neutral relationship with Sally too, and I've been trying to help. I think we should consider the possibility that the killer might be trying to make it look like a specific person or location, when in reality, it's something entirely different.""""

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Regan
3. Bryce
4. Tim
What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"Honestly, I don't have any concrete evidence, but I did notice that Tim and Regan were in the hallway when I was searching the kitchen. It seems like you both were avoiding the kitchen around the time I was looking for the key. I'm not saying you're the killers, but it does raise some questions. I'd like to hear your alibis for that time period.""""
Regan: """"I think it's interesting that Sally noticed Tim and I together in the hallway, but what about Bryce's sudden appearance in the bedroom right after Tim and I left the hallway? It seems like he might have been trying to sneak by or distract us from something. I think we should investigate his whereabouts around that time and see if anyone else noticed him.""""
Bryce: """"I've been trying to stay low-key and observe the group's movements, but I do want to point out that I've been consistently in the hallway when Regan and Tim were also present. It's possible that we were just trying to avoid the bathroom at the same time, which is where the previous murder occurred. However, I do want to mention that I was one of the first to go to the bathroom after the previous kill, and I didn't see or interact with anyone else in there. I'm happy to answer any questions and provide more context, but I think it's unfair to assume I'm a suspect based on Regan's sudden appearance in the bedroom.""""
Tim: """"I'd like to clarify my actions around that time. I was indeed in the hallway when Sally was searching the kitchen, but I was just going back and forth between the hallway and the kitchen, trying to gather more information. I didn't see Regan and I didn't interact with her in the hallway. I was also in the kitchen earlier when I searched the fridge, and I was alone there. I think it's fair to say that I was trying to gather clues and help figure out what was going on, just like everyone else. I don't have any concrete evidence or motives to be the killer, and I'm happy to provide more context and answer any questions you may have.""""

I also think we should pay attention to any inconsistencies in our alibis, as it might reveal something about the killer's behavior. We should work together, but we should also be cautious not to lead the killer to us.""""
Tim: """"I think we should also consider our alibis, but I'm more concerned about the fact that Regan is dead. I haven't had the chance to investigate much, but my first impression is that the bathroom seems to be a key area. I've searched the sink and shower, but didn't find anything. I'm starting to think that the killer might have been in the bathroom recently, possibly hiding the key or something else important.

I didn't have much interaction with Tim, but I did notice that he seemed pretty suspicious of someone earlier. And now that he's dead, I think it's possible that the killer was trying to throw us off the scent by saying Tim was looking into the bathroom. I'm not saying it's not worth investigating, but maybe we should keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions. After all, I've had a pretty neutral relationship with Sally too, and I've been trying to help.

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Regan
3. Bryce
4. Tim
What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"Honestly, I don't have any concrete evidence, but I did notice that Tim and Regan were in the hallway when I was searching the kitchen. It seems like you both were avoiding the kitchen around the time I was looking for the key. I'm not saying you're the killers, but it does raise some questions. I'd like to hear your alibis for that time period.""""
Regan: """"I think it's interesting that Sally noticed Tim and I together in the hallway, but what about Bryce's sudden appearance in the bedroom right after Tim and I left the hallway? It seems like he might have been trying to sneak by or distract us from something. I think we should investigate his whereabouts around that time and see if anyone else noticed him.""""
Bryce: """"I've been trying to stay low-key and observe the group's movements, but I do want to point out that I've been consistently in the hallway when Regan and Tim were also present. It's possible that we were just trying to avoid the bathroom at the same time, which is where the previous murder occurred. However, I do want to mention that I was one of the first to go to the bathroom after the previous kill, and I didn't see or interact with anyone else in there. I'm happy to answer any questions and provide more context, but I think it's unfair to assume I'm a suspect based on Regan's sudden appearance in the bedroom.""""
Tim: """"I'd like to clarify my actions around that time. I was indeed in the hallway when Sally was searching the kitchen, but I was just going back and forth between the hallway and the kitchen, trying to gather more information. I didn't see Regan and I didn't interact with her in the hallway. I was also in the kitchen earlier when I searched the fridge, and I was alone there. I think it's fair to say that I was trying to gather clues and help figure out what was going on, just like everyone else. I don't have any concrete evidence or motives to be the killer, and I'm happy to provide more context and answer any questions you may have.""""

What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"I've noticed that each of us seems to be investigating on our own, which could be a good thing, but it also means we might be missing out on important clues. I've searched the closet twice, but it didn't yield any results. I'd like to propose that we pool our information and work together to cover more ground. Maybe we can come up with a more effective strategy for finding the key and uncovering the truth.""""
Bryce: """"I think we should focus on one area at a time. I was just in the kitchen and I noticed it's been cleaned recently. Whoever the killer is, they seem to be leaving no mess behind. I also think we should pay attention to any inconsistencies in our alibis, as it might reveal something about the killer's behavior. We should work together, but we should also be cautious not to lead the killer to us.""""
Tim: """"I think we should also consider our alibis, but I'm more concerned about the fact that Regan is dead. I haven't had the chance to investigate much, but my first impression is that the bathroom seems to be a key area. I've searched the sink and shower, but didn't find anything. I'm starting to think that the killer might have been in the bathroom recently, possibly hiding the key or something else important. We should definitely work together, but we should also keep our eyes open for any clues that might have been missed, especially in areas like the bathroom.""""

What would you like to say? 
Bob: """"I've been observing everyone's movements, and I noticed that Regan was the only one who left me alone in the bedroom after I went there. Doesn't that seem suspicious to anyone?""""
Bryce: """"I think it's suspicious, but it's not conclusive. Regan might have just been trying to give Bob some space. I'd like to point out that I was alone in the kitchen for a while, but I didn't find any incriminating evidence. However, I did find a key in the cabinets, which might suggest that the killer was trying to mislead us. Maybe we should also look into the fact that Tim was killed when I was searching the cabinets, but it seems like it was after I left the kitchen. Let's not jump to conclusions just yet, but I think we should investigate further.""""
Sally: """"I've been observing everyone's movements as well, and I have to agree with Bob that Regan's behavior seems suspicious. However, as Bryce pointed out, it's not conclusive evidence. What I do find interesting is that Regan was also in the bathroom with us initially, and now that I think about it, she was one of the first to leave the bathroom when we had the chance to discuss our actions. I'm not saying she's definitely the killer, but it's definitely something to consider. Let's keep investigating and see if we can find any more clues or inconsistencies in each other's stories.""""
Regan: """"I understand that you all have your suspicions about me, and I appreciate the opportunity to clear the air. However, I think it's also worth noting that Bob and I were in the bathroom together initially, and now that I think about it, he was one of the first to leave the bathroom when we had the chance to discuss our actions. It seems like we've all been trying to deflect attention from ourselves. Let's not jump to conclusions or accuse each other just yet. Instead, let's focus on finding concrete evidence and piecing together the events that led to Tim's death.""""

She must have left shortly after I did, but she was alone when I thought she was with Bob. Second, I just got back from the bedroom and I didn't see any signs of a struggle or a hidden key. I think we should focus on the time frame and look for any inconsistencies in our alibis.""""
Sally: """"Regan was acting really strange earlier, and I remember seeing her go into the bathroom alone. I think she might have been the one searching for something, and maybe that's why she ended up in here. I'm not saying it's definitely her, but her behavior did seem suspicious.""""
Bob: """"I think Regan's death is suspicious, but I don't think she was the killer. Lena mentioned she was alone when Regan left the kitchen, but I was searching the cabinets at that time. I think Regan might have seen something or someone else, which could be connected to her death. I'd like to discuss the possible motives and suspects, but I think we should also consider the possibility that the killer might still be among us.""""

Regan: """"Regan, I think we should talk about Bryce's death and not jump to conclusions about who did it. I've been thinking, and I have some suspicions, but I'd rather discuss it one by one rather than pointing fingers. I do want to say, though, that Lena, Sally, and Bob all seemed pretty shaken when we first found out about Bryce. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe one of them is trying to hide something, but we need more evidence before we accuse anyone. What do you think, Regan?""""
Lena: """"I agree with Regan that we should approach this calmly. As for me, I didn't see anything that night, but I did notice that Sally was acting suspiciously when we found Bryce's body. She seemed nervous and kept glancing at the bathroom door. I'm not saying she did it, but it's definitely something to consider. I'm going to go see if I can find any clues or get more information from the others. I'm going to the hallway to see if anyone saw or heard anything suspicious.""""
Sally: """"I understand Regan's caution, and I appreciate Lena's observations. As for me, I think it's natural for people to be shaken when they find a body. I was definitely nervous when we first saw Bryce. However, I think it's also worth considering that we've all been stuck in this bathroom together for a while now, and tensions can run high. I'm more concerned about our limited resources and the fact that we have no way of communicating with the outside world. Can we discuss a plan for how we're going to survive and try to find a way out of here?""""
Bob: ""As I'm going to the Hallway, I quickly say, ""Actually, I was just going to say that I saw Sally go to the bathroom right before Bryce's body was found, and it seemed like she was in there for a while. I'm not pointing any fingers, but it's definitely something to consider. I'm also going to go to the hallway to see if I can find any clues or talk to anyone who might have seen or heard something suspicious. We should all try to stay calm and work together to figure out what happened.""""

Sally was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Bob
2. Tim
3. Lena
4. Regan
What would you like to say? 
Bob: """"I think we can rule out Bob since he's speaking right now. My suspicion falls on Tim, Regan, and Lena, all of whom are in a neutral relationship with me. Sally was killed, so it's likely someone who's not too close to us. However, it's also possible that the killer is someone who's trying to mislead us.""""
Tim: """"I'd like to add that I don't think it's Regan, as they were in the bathroom with Sally when she was killed. It's possible that Regan was just as unaware of the killer's intentions as the rest of us. However, I do think we should keep an eye on them, just in case.""""
Lena: """"I agree with Bob and Tim that it's possible the killer is someone who's trying to mislead us. Given that Sally's body was found in the hallway, I think it's worth investigating if Regan was in the bathroom with Sally right before she was killed. But, on the other hand, I also find it suspicious that Bob is trying to rule himself out. Maybe we should keep a close eye on everyone, including Bob, and see how their actions play out.""""
Regan: """"I think it's worth mentioning that I was in the bathroom with Sally and Tim, but we were all searching the room together. We didn't leave the bathroom until I decided to go to the hallway. I'm not sure if this helps, but I didn't notice anyone suspicious while we were in the bathroom. I'd like to know more about the events leading up to Sally's death and see if we can find any other clues.""""

What would you like to say? 
Tim: """"I think it's clear that the killer has been careful to mislead us, but with Regan and Bob out of the picture, I think I can safely say that it's not me. Given that Lena and I were in different rooms, I think it's highly unlikely that she could have killed Bob without me noticing. However, Lena was a suspect from the start, and her behavior in the previous discussion was a bit suspicious. I'd like to propose a thorough search of Lena's belongings and actions to see if we can find any clues pointing to her guilt.""""
Lena: """"I agree with Tim that the killer has been trying to mislead us. However, I think we should consider the fact that I was in the bathroom when Regan was banished, and I had the opportunity to go to the hallway where Bob was killed. Although I didn't leave the bathroom, it's still possible that I could have snuck out and committed the crime. Given that I was a suspect from the start, I think it's essential to investigate my actions and belongings thoroughly, just as Tim suggested. Let's work together to uncover the truth and find the killer.""""

You saw Regan kill Lena in the Bedroom!

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players:

4. Sally
What would you like to say? 
Regan: """"Bryce and Tim, I've noticed you two were in the hallway when Lena was still alive. That's the same time I was in the bedroom, alone. I'm not accusing you two, but I think one of you might want to explain what you were doing together.""""
Bryce: """"I think we can all agree, Regan's statement is suspicious and needs clarification. As for me, I was searching the cabinets in the kitchen when Lena was still alive. I didn't see or interact with Regan at that time. I think we should also consider the fact that Sally was with us, but Regan didn't mention anything about her. I'm not accusing anyone yet, but I do think we need to hear more about Regan's alibi.""""
Tim: """"Hey, I think it's worth mentioning that I was alone in the hallway for a short time before going to the bedroom. However, I didn't see anyone else, and my next move was to go to the bedroom. I didn't notice anything suspicious, but I did go back to the hallway after that, which Regan pointed out. I'm not sure what to make of this, but I think we should focus on the fact that Sally was with Bryce in the kitchen when Lena was still alive. Sally, can you tell us what you were doing during that time?""""
Sally: """"I was searching the fridge when Bryce joined me in the kitchen. We were together for a bit, but after that, I went back to the hallway to meet Regan. I didn't see anyone else around, and I didn't notice anything suspicious. However, I do want to mention that I was in the hallway when Lena was alive, and I was alone for a short time before meeting Regan. I'm not pointing fingers, but I think it's interesting that Bryce and I were both in the kitchen around the same time Lena was killed, and we didn't think to search the fridge again together after that. Maybe we should have checked it again in case we missed something.""""

I don't think I was in the kitchen around the time of Lena's death, and I didn't have any opportunity to commit the crime. Tim, on the other hand, seems to have been quite vague about his alibi in the kitchen. His claim of not seeing Sally in the hallway after leaving the kitchen doesn't necessarily mean he didn't see her, and it doesn't account for his own movements. With his high rating of our relationship, I think Tim might be hiding something.""""
Tim: """"I understand Regan's concerns, but I think we need to consider my actual actions, not just my alibi. I was alone in the kitchen and then the hallway, and I didn't see anyone in the kitchen after I left. I'm not sure what more I can do to prove my innocence. My relationship rating with Regan is high, but I'd like to think that's because we've had neutral and respectful interactions, not because I'm hiding something.

Bryce: """"I think we're jumping to conclusions too quickly. We don't have enough information to pinpoint a killer yet. However, I do want to mention that I saw Sally in the hallway when I was going to the kitchen. Could you have been in the kitchen around the time Lena was killed, Sally?""""
Tim: """"I agree with Bryce, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. But I do have some information that might be helpful. I was alone in the kitchen before going to the hallway, and then I was alone in the hallway before entering the bedroom. I didn't see anyone in the kitchen after I left, but I also didn't see Sally in the hallway when I was walking towards the bedroom. As for my relationship with each of you, I'd say Regan and I are acquaintances, and we had a neutral conversation. I've barely interacted with Sally, so I'd rate our relationship as a 4. I don't know Bryce well, but I'd rate our relationship as a 6, given our brief conversation in the hallway. My primary goal here is to figure out who the killer is, and I'm open to working together to uncover the truth.""""

What would you like to say? 
Regan: """"I think we can both safely say that Sally and Bryce are no longer a concern. I don't think I was in the kitchen around the time of Lena's death, and I didn't have any opportunity to commit the crime. Tim, on the other hand, seems to have been quite vague about his alibi in the kitchen. His claim of not seeing Sally in the hallway after leaving the kitchen doesn't necessarily mean he didn't see her, and it doesn't account for his own movements. With his high rating of our relationship, I think Tim might be hiding something.""""
Tim: """"I understand Regan's concerns, but I think we need to consider my actual actions, not just my alibi. I was alone in the kitchen and then the hallway, and I didn't see anyone in the kitchen after I left. I'm not sure what more I can do to prove my innocence. My relationship rating with Regan is high, but I'd like to think that's because we've had neutral and respectful interactions, not because I'm hiding something. I think Regan's accusation is based more on speculation than fact.""""

What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"I'm not sure yet, but I have to say, I'm a bit surprised Regan is gone. She seemed pretty chill. I don't think any of us had any major beefs with her. I'd say keep an eye on Tim, though - he's been pretty quiet so far, and that can be suspicious.""""
Tim: """"I agree that Regan seemed pretty laid back, but that's exactly what worries me. People like that often seem too good to be true. I've noticed that we all had interactions with her, but I was the one who went to the hallway alone. Maybe that was just a coincidence, but it's possible she was waiting for the perfect moment to make a move. I'm not saying it's definitely me, but I do think we should be looking at our own alibis more closely.""""
Lena: """"Hey everyone, I have to say I'm pretty shocked by what happened too. I was in the hallway and I saw Sally kill Regan. I know this sounds crazy, but I'm just stating the facts. I'm not accusing anyone, but I do think we should consider the possibility that it was one of us who snapped. I've been trying to piece together what happened, but it seems like a lot of us were moving around at the same time. I'm not sure if I'm looking at anyone in particular, but I think we should be honest about our actions so far. Tim, you said you went to the hallway alone, but I didn't see you go. And Bob, you just appeared in the kitchen - where were you?""""
Bob: """"Hey guys, I'm still trying to process what happened. I was in the hallway, but I think I was a bit too far away to see what happened. I did see Regan earlier, though, and we had a pretty brief conversation. I have to say, I'm a bit concerned that we're already jumping to conclusions and accusing each other. Let's take a step back and think this through. I agree with Lena that we should be honest about our actions, but let's also consider that we might be overlooking something. I've been thinking about my own actions, and I did see Sally in the hallway earlier. She seemed to be heading towards the kitchen, but I didn't see her come back. Does anyone know if she's been in the kitchen the whole time?""""

Lena was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan
2. Tim
3. Bob
4. Sally
What would you like to say? 
Regan: """"I'm thinking... with Lena gone, I'm looking at the people who seemed neutral, and it's interesting that Tim, Bob, and Sally all had a 5 on their scales from me. It suggests we're all somewhat evenly matched. But if I had to point a finger, I'd say it's either Tim or Bob. They both had access to the kitchen before Lena was killed, and their actions seem to be... neutral, just like mine. But, to be honest, I think I'm more suspicious of myself.""""
Tim: """"I have to agree with Regan's assessment of our neutral actions. However, I'd like to point out that we're all in the same situation - we're trying to escape and we're all equally matched in our initial assessments. But I think what's more telling is that Regan had a neutral assessment of me, but Lena was killed. It could suggest that the killer is not necessarily the one who's neutral, but the one who's most concerned about being seen as neutral. So, I think it's worth looking at Bob and Sally's actions more closely. Did they make any moves that could be seen as suspicious or did they stick to their neutral behavior?""""
Bob: """"I think we're focusing too much on the scales and the neutral behavior. While it's true that Regan and I had a neutral assessment of each other, I think it's more about our actions in the past few minutes. I've been searching for the key, trying to find a way out, while you all have been discussing who the killer might be. Maybe I've been too focused on my own goals, but it doesn't necessarily mean I'm the killer. I think we should be looking at Regan's sudden interest in the other players' actions and her almost accusatory tone towards Tim. It seems like she's trying to deflect attention from herself.""""
Sally: """"I think we're all trying to analyze this from different angles, but I'd like to add my own perspective. As I was observing Regan's words, I noticed that she mentioned being more suspicious of herself. That seems like a red flag to me, almost like she's trying to throw us off her trail. Additionally, I remember when we were in the bathroom earlier, Regan and Bob were in there together, and now Regan is suggesting that Bob could be the killer. I think Regan's trying to create a smokescreen and distract us from her own potential involvement. But, I also agree with Tim that we should be looking at everyone's actions more closely, including Bob's and my own. Maybe we should start by analyzing our own alibis and making sure we're not missing any crucial details.""""

As for the key, I think it's worth investigating further, but we need to consider the possibility that it was planted by the actual killer to mislead us. I've been thinking about Bob's relationships with each of us, and I have to say, I'm a bit concerned about our own relationships with each other. If I had to pick someone, I'd say I'm a bit suspicious of Regan's comment about being close to you, Regan. It seems a bit convenient.

As for the key, I think it's worth investigating further, but we need to consider the possibility that it was planted by the actual killer to mislead us. I've been thinking about Bob's relationships with each of us, and I have to say, I'm a bit concerned about our own relationships with each other. If I had to pick someone, I'd say I'm a bit suspicious of Regan's comment about being close to you, Regan. It seems a bit convenient.

Regan: """"Hey guys, now that Sally's gone, I think it's time for us to take a closer look at each other's alibis. Tim and I were just discussing this, and we realized that we both have strong motives and means to commit the crime. I'm not saying it's one of us, but we should definitely investigate further. Tim mentioned that Sally was acting suspiciously, but now that she's gone, it's hard to know if she was trying to frame someone or if she was actually the killer. Let's focus on finding any clues that might point to the killer's identity.""""
Tim: """"I think it's worth considering the possibility that the killer might be someone we haven't suspected yet. I was in the kitchen when Sally was killed, but I didn't see anyone else around. I'm still looking for the key, and I was wondering if anyone saw anyone else in the kitchen around that time. I don't have any alibis to defend myself, so I'm open to any new information that might come up.""""

Regan was also with him, and their actions seemed to be more innocent than suspicious. But I do think one person's movement is suspicious - Lena.

Bryce: """"It seems like a pretty weak accusation, Lena. I was just trying to stay out of the main action for a bit. I don't think it's suspicious that I went to the hallway to see what was going on, and then to the bedroom because I thought there might be more information there. I'm not trying to hide anything from you.""""
Tim: """"I think Lena has a point, though. Your actions do seem a bit calculated. But I'm not sure it's necessarily sinister. I've also been trying to stay out of the main action, at least at first. I went to the hallway to see if I could find any other players, and then I made my way to the kitchen and back to the hallway. My suspicion is actually on Regan, who seems to have been moving around quite a bit. I've seen her in the hallway and in the bedroom, and she's been interacting with Lena and Sally. She might have had the opportunity to get close to Sally without anyone noticing.""""
Regan: """"I think we're all trying to make connections where there might not be any. I was in the kitchen initially, then I saw Sally and decided to approach her. We talked, and I moved on to the hallway to see if I could find any other players. I did see you, Lena, and we interacted briefly. I then moved to the bedroom to try and gather more information. I didn't have any reason to suspect Sally's presence there, and I didn't interact with her in a way that would have allowed me to get close to her without being noticed. I think we should consider the possibility that the killer might be someone who was already in the room with Sally, rather than someone who was moving around outside of it.""""

Lena: """"I think we should re-evaluate our previous discussions and consider new evidence. With Tim's death, I believe Regan becomes a prime suspect. Her actions seemed quite calculated and she was able to gather information in various locations, including the bedroom where Tim was killed. I also notice that Regan has voted to banish me in the previous turn, which raises some red flags. I'd like to call out Regan and see if she has any alibi or motive for Tim's death.""""
Bryce: """"I think Lena's got a point there, Regan's actions have been suspicious. However, I also recall that Regan went to the hallway in Turn 8, the same time our killer did. It seems like she was trying to cover her tracks or possibly waiting for an opportunity. I'd like to ask Regan, if you were in the hallway, where were you before that?

Regan: """"I think both Lena and Bryce have raised some valid points, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet. I'd like to clarify a few things. Yes, I did go to the hallway in Turn 8, but my intention was to investigate and gather information, not to cover my tracks.

His vote to banish Tim also seems suspicious, and I'd like to ask him about that now.""
Bob: """"I'm shocked and saddened by Tim's death, but I think we should also consider the new information that has come to light. As I was alone in the bedroom with Tim, I think I can provide an alibi for myself. However, I want to ask Regan, now that we know he's capable of violence, about his suspicious vote to banish Tim earlier. It seems like a classic move to deflect attention from oneself, and I think we should investigate that further. Plus, Regan was in the kitchen with Tim right before the murder, which raises some red flags. I'd like to hear Regan's explanation for his actions and vote, but I'm inclined to think that he might be our killer.""""
Regan: """"I'm not sure why you're both focusing on me, but I think it's a good thing you're discussing my vote to banish Tim. To clarify, my vote was based on my analysis of our relationships, which put Tim as my lowest priority to protect, and I thought it would be a strategic move to remove him from the group. I wasn't trying to deflect attention from myself, but rather focusing on the bigger picture. As for being in the kitchen with Tim, I was just grabbing a drink, and I didn't see or hear anything unusual. I think we should be looking at our relationships and interactions with each other more closely, rather than immediately suspecting the person who's been speaking up. We should also consider the fact that Lena has been quiet and hasn't spoken up much, and Tim was killed right after we discussed our relationships in the bedroom. Maybe we should be paying more attention to Lena's motives and actions?""""

However, I do want to point out that Regan herself has been moving around quite a bit, especially after Tim's death, and she was the one who was alone with you in the bedroom when Tim's body was found. That seems suspicious to me, given the circumstances. But I'm not convinced it's one of us. I think we should look closer at Sally's alibis, as she's been pretty quiet throughout this whole game.""""

I want to remind everyone that I was actually searching the cabinets in the kitchen, and I didn't find the key.

Regan: """"I'd like to address Bryce's statement. While he's right that he was searching the cabinets, I didn't mention the timing as a coincidence. I brought it up because it seemed suspicious to me that he joined the conversation when Sally was already dead. However, now that I think about it, the timing of Bryce's actions is actually more plausible now that Tim is dead. It seems like Bryce was in the kitchen at the time of the murder, but his statement makes sense if he was looking for the key and then joined the conversation later. But, that also raises another question - who was with Tim in the hallway? Bryce said he was in the kitchen, but if Tim went to the hallway and then the bedroom, who was with him in the hallway?""""
Bob: """"I think Regan's question raises a good point. Since I was in the hallway, and I'm the one who killed Tim, I should be able to answer who was with him. Bryce said he was in the kitchen, and I didn't see anyone else in the hallway when I was there. It's possible that Tim was alone, but I also want to remind you that I was in the hallway for a very short time, and I was focused on my target.

I brought it up because it seemed suspicious to me that he joined the conversation when Sally was already dead.

Regan: """"I agree with Sally that we all have neutral relationships, but I think we can also consider our actions so far. I searched the fridge and the cabinets, but didn't find the key. Meanwhile, Sally searched the cabinets after I did, and found Lena's body. That suggests to me that Sally might have been involved, or at least had access to the area. I'd like to ask her what she was doing in the kitchen around the time I was searching the cabinets.""""
Tim: """"I think Regan has a valid point about Sally's timing, but I'd like to add another perspective. I've been watching Bryce, and he left the kitchen immediately after I did. He seemed a bit too calm and collected, considering we were all supposed to be searching for the key.

Bryce: """"I understand where Regan and Tim are coming from, but I think there's an important detail that's been overlooked. I was searching the cabinets initially, and then I searched the fridge. That means I had access to the kitchen during the time of the murder. However, I didn't find the key, which suggests that the killer might not have been looking for it.

I didn't have much interaction with her, but from what I saw, she seemed a bit nervous and on edge. I don't think it's fair to accuse anyone yet, but we should definitely discuss our alibis and see if anyone noticed anything unusual.""""

However, I did notice that Bryce and Regan were together earlier, and now she's dead. That's a pretty suspicious connection. I'm not saying Bryce is guilty, but it's definitely worth exploring further. We should also consider the fact that the key was found in the fridge, and now it's mentioned.

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Lena
2. Bryce
3. Sally
4. Regan
What would you like to say? 
Lena: """"I think we should consider Regan, since we found Bob's body near the bedroom. The fact that we were all searching the bedroom together might suggest Regan took the opportunity to kill him when no one was looking.""""
Bryce: """"I think Lena's theory is a good start, but I believe we're overlooking a crucial detail. Bob was found in the kitchen, not near the bedroom. Also, considering the fact that we've only been in the kitchen for a turn, I think it's unlikely Regan had enough time to move Bob's body. My suspicion is that the killer is one of the ones who were here with us from the start, possibly even someone who hasn't spoken up yet.""""
Sally: """"I think Bryce makes a valid point about the body being found in the kitchen. However, I also want to consider the possibility that the killer could be one of us who was in the bedroom before we all gathered there. I've noticed that Lena found the key in the pillow, which led us to leave the bedroom. Maybe the killer was one of us who was in the bedroom first and had a motive to get rid of Bob.""""
Regan: """"I think we're overcomplicating things. Let's not forget that I've been with you all from the start, and I'm the one who's been quietly observing the conversation. I think the killer is one of the ones who made a suspicious move, and I'm not just talking about the body being moved. I'm looking at the ones who seemed to be in a rush or were trying to change the subject. Specifically, Lena's story about finding the key in the pillow seems a bit too convenient to me.""""
