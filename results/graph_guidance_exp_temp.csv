Given my own actions, I've been to the hallway alone, but I think I can rule myself out since I didn't kill Bryce in the bedroom. I also didn't notice anything suspicious when I was with Tim in the hallway and bedroom. My real concern is that Regan hasn't spoken up yet, and since I've never seen Regan interact with anyone else, it makes me wonder if they might be our killer.""""
Tim: """"Actually, I think I can rule myself out as a suspect since I've only been in rooms with others and I didn't have the opportunity to kill Bryce when we were all together. Also, I didn't have a chance to kill anyone when I was alone in the kitchen. My concern is more about who was in the kitchen alone, but I think it's unlikely to be either Sally or Bob since we were discussing this and they're not the type to kill someone out of the blue. I think we should focus on the fact that Bryce was killed in the bedroom, and the fact that I, Sally, and Bob were all in the bedroom together before Bryce's death. Maybe we should investigate our actions more closely in the bedroom.""""
Regan: """"I've been thinking about my actions, and I was the one who went to the bedroom alone after being in the hallway with Sally and Bryce. I didn't interact with anyone else until I came back to the hallway, but I didn't have the opportunity to kill Bryce since I was back in the hallway when he was killed. However, I want to point out that I was alone in the bathroom for a bit, and while I don't think I'm the killer, I do think that the fact that we've been discussing the pattern of the killer's movements suggests that they might be one of us who's been in the same room with others.

Given that I was in the hallway alone before the game started, I could have easily set the stage for the killer's pattern. However, I don't think I'm the killer. I think Tim here has been playing it too safe, always sticking with others and not taking any risks. If I had to guess, I'd say Tim is the most likely candidate to be the killer. His 'I can rule myself out' statement earlier seems suspicious to me, and it's almost like he was trying to deflect attention away from himself.""""
Tim: """"I don't think that's fair, Sally. Just because I'm playing it safe doesn't mean I'm the killer. You're making assumptions based on your own interpretation of my actions, but you don't know the full picture. As for my statement, I was simply trying to reassure everyone that I had an alibi for the time Regan was killed. It was a genuine attempt to clear my own name, not deflect attention.

1. Sally

What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"I think it's clear that the killer is one of us, and now that Regan is gone, it narrows it down to us two. Given that I was in the hallway alone before the game started, I could have easily set the stage for the killer's pattern. However, I don't think I'm the killer. I think Tim here has been playing it too safe, always sticking with others and not taking any risks. If I had to guess, I'd say Tim is the most likely candidate to be the killer. His 'I can rule myself out' statement earlier seems suspicious to me, and it's almost like he was trying to deflect attention away from himself.""""
Tim: """"I don't think that's fair, Sally. Just because I'm playing it safe doesn't mean I'm the killer. You're making assumptions based on your own interpretation of my actions, but you don't know the full picture. As for my statement, I was simply trying to reassure everyone that I had an alibi for the time Regan was killed. It was a genuine attempt to clear my own name, not deflect attention.

What would you like to say? 
Regan: """"Regan, I'm shocked to hear that Tim has been killed. With Sally already banished, I think it's becoming clearer that the killer is trying to cover their tracks. As I was analyzing our previous actions, I realized that Lena had a very suspicious alibi - she claimed to be searching for the key but ended up killing Bob in the bedroom. Considering her behavior and her vote to banish Sally, I think she's our prime suspect. I would like to propose that we search the bedroom and the hallway again for any clues that might have been missed, and also investigate Regan's sudden appearance in the bedroom during the crime. Let's work together to uncover the truth.""""
Lena: """"I think Regan is misinterpreting the situation. Just because I had an alibi for one action doesn't mean I couldn't have been the killer for another. And, as for my vote to banish Sally, it's a common strategy to get rid of the most obvious suspect and create a diversion. I think Regan's sudden appearance in the bedroom during the crime is more suspicious than mine. She's the one who claimed to have been searching for the key, but now she's the one who's been in the bedroom during two murders. I think we should be investigating Regan's actions more closely.""""

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Tim
2. Sally
3. Regan
4. Lena
What would you like to say? 
Tim: """"Tim, I think we should consider our individual actions and movements during the game so far. None of us have interacted with each other directly, but we've all been searching for the key. I found it in the fridge, but I have to admit, I didn't see anyone else near it. My initial suspicion might be Bob, but since he's already been killed, it's not like he could have done it. I think we should look at our own actions and see if anyone noticed anything unusual, like entering the kitchen around the time the key was found. Does anyone remember seeing anyone else move towards the fridge?""""
Sally: """"I agree with Tim, we should examine our own actions and see if anyone recalls anything suspicious. I entered the hallway, where I met Regan, and then went to the bedroom. I searched the closet but didn't find the key. However, I did see Lena kill Bob. My suspicion falls on her, as she was the one I saw committing the crime.""""
Regan: """"I agree that our individual actions are crucial to figuring this out. I was alone in the bathroom initially, then moved to the hallway where I met Sally, and after that, I went to the bedroom where I witnessed Lena killing Bob. It's quite suspicious that I was in the hallway and then suddenly ended up in the bedroom right when the crime happened. However, I didn't see Lena enter the hallway, and I don't recall seeing anyone else suspiciously lingering around the bedroom doors. My suspicion is on both Sally and Lena since they both had opportunities to commit the crime, but I do have to admit, Lena's direct involvement does raise more red flags.""""
Lena: """"I'm shocked to hear that I'm being accused. I didn't commit the crime, I was searching for the key and didn't find it. I did see Bob, and I even searched the same area he was in when... it happened. I didn't see him move or notice anything suspicious. I think we should look at the facts and not jump to conclusions. Maybe we should also consider Regan's presence in the hallway and how she suddenly ended up in the bedroom around the time of the crime. She seemed to appear out of nowhere, just like me when I was in the hallway, but I was on my way to the kitchen, not the bedroom. Maybe we should investigate the hallway and see if there are any other clues that could point to the real killer.""""

Tim voted to banish Sally
Sally voted to banish Regan
Regan voted to banish Sally
Lena voted to banish Sally
Sally was banished from the house!

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Regan
2. Lena
What would you like to say? 
Regan: """"Regan, I'm shocked to hear that Tim has been killed. With Sally already banished, I think it's becoming clearer that the killer is trying to cover their tracks. As I was analyzing our previous actions, I realized that Lena had a very suspicious alibi - she claimed to be searching for the key but ended up killing Bob in the bedroom. Considering her behavior and her vote to banish Sally, I think she's our prime suspect. I would like to propose that we search the bedroom and the hallway again for any clues that might have been missed, and also investigate Regan's sudden appearance in the bedroom during the crime. Let's work together to uncover the truth.""""
Lena: """"I think Regan is misinterpreting the situation. Just because I had an alibi for one action doesn't mean I couldn't have been the killer for another. And, as for my vote to banish Sally, it's a common strategy to get rid of the most obvious suspect and create a diversion. I think Regan's sudden appearance in the bedroom during the crime is more suspicious than mine. She's the one who claimed to have been searching for the key, but now she's the one who's been in the bedroom during two murders. I think we should be investigating Regan's actions more closely.""""

Tim has been a bit suspicious, but we haven't seen him move around much. My concern is that the killer might be someone who can manipulate the situation to appear innocent, and since I was alone in the bedroom at the start, I'm going to take a chance and say that the killer might be me, or... Bob, you've been really quiet and were the first to know we were in the hallway when I returned. Your knowledge of my actions could be valuable information for the killer.""""
Lena: """"I have to agree with Bob, Regan and I were in the hallway when he returned, so it's possible she had some foreknowledge. However, I also noticed that Regan seemed quite shaken when Sally was killed, which could be genuine or an act. As for Tim, he was in the kitchen with Sally, but we didn't see him leave the kitchen, so it's unclear if he was involved. I think we should keep an eye on Tim, but I don't think we can rule out Regan just yet.""""
Tim: """"I think I have a different perspective on this situation. I was in the kitchen with Sally initially, and then I went to the hallway. I didn't find the key, which made me suspicious, but I didn't see any evidence of foul play.

Bob was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players:

What would you like to say? 
Regan: ""Now that Bob's been killed, I think it's time to reassess our previous discussions. Sally had accused me of being the killer earlier, but now I'm inclined to believe that might have been a tactic to distract us from her own guilt. Given her behavior and comments, I think Sally might be more involved in the killings than we initially thought. Her attempts to deflect attention and accuse others raise some red flags for me.""
Sally: """"I think Regan is trying to shift the focus from herself to me, just like Bob did earlier. She's pointing fingers and trying to deflect attention, but I think she's just trying to distract us from her own involvement. Her sudden change of heart about me being the killer doesn't seem genuine to me. I think she's trying to play us all, and I'm not convinced she's innocent.""""

However, I didn't see any of you around after that, so it's hard to say for sure. I guess I'm open to considering any of you as a suspect, but I'm not leaning towards any particular person at this point.""""
Bob: """"I've also had a neutral relationship with all of you, but I have to say, my suspicions do lean towards Sally. We were both in the bedroom when the key search happened, and I didn't notice you leaving. And now, Tim's been killed. It seems like an opportunity for someone to slip in unnoticed.""""
Regan: """"I've had a pretty neutral relationship with everyone, with Lena being at the lower end of my list. I didn't see any of you after the key search in the kitchen, but I do recall seeing Sally near the bathroom door, around the time Tim's body was found. I'm not saying she's definitely the killer, but her proximity to the bathroom does seem suspicious.""""
Sally: """"I think we're focusing too much on past interactions and physical locations. We need to consider the killer's actions. We know the killer is trying to get to the key, but they had the opportunity to search for it earlier. They chose not to and instead killed Tim. That suggests they might be someone who wants to eliminate potential competition rather than find the key quickly. Considering that, I think we should be looking at Bob. His neutral relationships and lack of alibi after the key search make him a strong suspect. Let's keep an eye on him.""""

What would you like to say? 
Bob: """"Considering the recent events, I'm starting to think that Sally might be the killer. Initially, I suspected her too, but her suggestion to banish me seemed suspicious. Now that Lena's been killed, I think Sally might be trying to frame me or distract us from her own guilt. I also recall Regan mentioning seeing Sally near the bathroom door, which adds to my suspicions about her. I'm not convinced that Regan is the killer, but I'm definitely looking at Sally more closely now.""""
Regan: """"""I have to say, I'm a bit surprised by Bob's sudden change in opinion. He was just as quick to suspect me earlier, and now he's pointing fingers at Sally. I think this might be a clever attempt to throw us off his trail. I'm not convinced that Sally is the killer, but I do think Bob's trying to deflect attention from himself. I'll keep an eye on him, but for now, I'm not ready to make any accusations.""""
Sally: """"I've been listening to your theories, and I have to say, I'm impressed by Bob's attempt to deflect attention from himself. However, I think it's time to look at the facts. We know the killer has a history of eliminating potential competition, and now that Lena's been killed, it's clear that they're not interested in finding the key quickly. I think it's time to look at the player who's been consistently trying to figure out who the killer is. Regan, your attempts to gather information and your concerns about Bob's sudden change of heart suggest to me that you might be onto something. But, what if I told you that I think you're the one who's been trying to throw us off the scent the whole time?""""

Bob: """"I've been thinking, and I don't have any strong suspicions yet. However, I do recall that Lena was in the Bedroom around the time of her death, and I was the last one to interact with the space before going to the Hallway. I think it's worth investigating the Bedroom and seeing if anyone noticed anything unusual.""""
Bryce: """"I think it's pretty clear that whoever the killer is, they're trying to keep a low profile. I didn't see anything suspicious myself, but I did notice that Sally seemed a bit distant and was acting strangely when I asked her about her whereabouts earlier. Not saying she's the killer, but it's definitely worth paying closer attention to her.""""
Tim: """"I think it's interesting that Bryce brought up Sally's behavior. I've had a chance to interact with Sally too, and while I didn't notice anything overtly suspicious, I did feel a bit uncomfortable when I asked her about the key I was looking for. She seemed evasive and changed the subject quickly. I'm not saying she's definitely the killer, but it's definitely a red flag for me. Maybe we should keep a closer eye on her and see if we can uncover more information about her whereabouts during Lena's death.""""
Sally: """"I have to admit, I've been trying to avoid drawing attention to myself so far, but I don't want to be suspected unfairly. I was in the Bathroom when I heard the scream, and then I went to the Hallway. I didn't see anyone, but I did see the door to the Bedroom was open. I didn't think much of it at the time, but now it seems suspicious. I want to assure you all that I had nothing to do with Lena's death. If you're going to investigate, I suggest looking into who was in the Bedroom before we all converged in the Hallway. I was in the Hallway the whole time.""""

Sally: """"I don't think it's fair to jump to conclusions about Sally, Tim. While it's true that she was cautious in her accusations, that doesn't necessarily mean she's the killer. I'd like to point out that I've been searching the house, and I haven't found any clues that point directly to Sally. In fact, my searches have led me to question whether Bob might have had something to do with Regan's death. I remember that Bob was the one who mentioned Tim and Regan's intense conversation, and it seems suspicious that Bob would bring that up now.

However, I didn't have any motive to kill him, and I don't think I would've had the chance to do it quickly enough anyway. I'm more inclined to think it might have been one of you guys who saw him go in and took the opportunity. But I have to say, I'm also a bit suspicious of Regan, since he wasn't in the bathroom with Bryce and me, and he could've easily slipped in and out without anyone noticing.""""
Tim: """"Hey guys, let's think about this logically. I was in the hallway when I saw Lena go to the bathroom, and I was still there when I saw her leave. It was around that time that I heard a noise from the bathroom. While I didn't see anything, it raises a red flag for me. I'm not sure if Lena had the time to kill Bryce before she left, but it's definitely a possibility.""""
Regan: """"Alright, let's consider the facts. I wasn't in the bathroom, so I didn't have the opportunity to kill Bryce. I was in the hallway, then went to the kitchen, and finally returned to the hallway. My timeline checks out. However, what I find interesting is that Tim was in the hallway when he heard a noise from the bathroom, and he didn't seem to notice my return to the hallway afterwards. Doesn't that seem suspicious to anyone?""""

As for me, I've been trying to piece together our timeline and remember if I saw anything unusual, but I'm not getting anything concrete. I think we need to keep observing each other and see if anyone slips up.""""
Lena: """"I agree with what Regan and Sally have said so far. I think we should focus on looking for any potential motives and see if we can find any physical evidence that might point to the killer. As for me, I didn't see anything unusual when we were in the bathroom, but I did notice that Regan seemed to be acting a bit strangely after we found Bob's body.

And let's not forget, we were all in the bathroom together, but I distinctly remember seeing Lena glance at the hallway for a few seconds before we entered. I'm not saying that's a red flag, but it's definitely something that caught my attention. As for motives, I think we should be looking at Regan's past interactions with Bob.

What would you like to say? 
Bryce: """"I don't think it's a good idea to point fingers at anyone just yet. We should be more concerned about our own alibis. When was the last time each of us was in the kitchen? I was in the living room, and I didn't leave until I heard the scream. Sally, you were in the hallway with us, but I'm not sure if you had the opportunity to sneak into the kitchen. Lena and Tim, I haven't seen either of you for a while, so you both had a lot of time to do... whatever it is you did.""""
Sally: """"I don't think we should focus solely on our alibis. We should also think about motive. Was Bob a threat to anyone in the group? Who stood to gain from his death?""""
Lena: """"I agree with Sally that motive is an important factor to consider. As for my alibi, I was in the bedroom with Sally and Sally will confirm that we were there for a bit. We were searching for something, but I didn't leave the bedroom until we moved to the hallway. I don't think I had the opportunity to kill Bob, but I did see Sally and Bryce in the hallway together before we all gathered here. Maybe we should also think about any potential conflicts or rivalries within the group.""""
Tim: """"Actually, I was in the hallway too, and I remember seeing Bryce and Sally talking to each other, but I didn't see Lena with them at that time. As for motive, I think we should consider who might have benefited from Bob's death. Since Bob had the key, whoever killed him must have also found it. I've already found the key in the shower, but I didn't have the chance to kill Bob.

Regan: """"I was in the hallway, so I didn't hear anything unusual, but I can confirm that I was alone for a bit before entering the hallway.

It seems like she's been shadowing me. Plus, we both had a neutral relationship before, so there's no clear motive for her to have killed Bob, but it's still suspicious.""""

My goal was to try and find the key, not to stalk anyone. I'd like to remind you all that we're all neutral with each other, and we've been working together to find the key.

I think we should be looking at each other and our actions in the bathroom, not Lena's movements.""
Lena: """"I agree with Bryce that we need to focus on the facts, especially regarding our actions in the bathroom. However, I also think we should consider the fact that I didn't find the key in the closet, which could suggest that the killer is still in the house with us. Given our relationship, I would rate you, Bryce, as a 5, and I wouldn't say we're enemies, but I wouldn't consider you a friend either.

Tim: """"I agree with Bryce. I noticed that Lena and I were in the kitchen together, then she followed me to the hallway and the bedroom, while the rest of you didn't move. It seems like she's been shadowing me. Plus, we both had a neutral relationship before, so there's no clear motive for her to have killed Bob, but it's still suspicious.""""
Lena: """"I don't think it's fair to make assumptions based on my movements. I was simply following the actions of other players to observe their behavior. My goal was to try and find the key, not to stalk anyone. I'd like to remind you all that we're all neutral with each other, and we've been working together to find the key. Let's not jump to conclusions and accuse each other without solid evidence. Let's focus on finding the key and figuring out who the actual killer is.""""

As for my own actions, I didn't really notice Lena following me, but I did notice that every time I entered the bedroom, I was alone. I didn't think much of it at the time, but now that you mention it, it is a bit strange. However, I don't think we should jump to conclusions just yet.

I think we should be looking at each other and our actions in the bathroom, not Lena's movements.""
Lena: """"I agree with Bryce that we need to focus on the facts, especially regarding our actions in the bathroom. However, I also think we should consider the fact that I didn't find the key in the closet, which could suggest that the killer is still in the house with us. Given our relationship, I would rate you, Bryce, as a 5, and I wouldn't say we're enemies, but I wouldn't consider you a friend either. I'm not sure what to make of our neutral relationship, and I think it's possible that one of us might be the killer.

I remember how Lena pointed out that she didn't have a clear alibi, and I think we should investigate that further. Additionally, Lena's vote to banish Bryce seemed suspicious, considering Bryce was trying to point out potential flaws in everyone's alibis. I'm not saying Lena is the killer, but I think we should keep a closer eye on her.""""
Lena: """"I agree with Regan that Lena's sudden involvement in discussions and her vote to banish Bryce does seem suspicious. However, I'd like to remind everyone that I was actually the one who pointed out Bryce's potential flaws in everyone's alibis. If anyone seems suspicious, I think we should also look at Regan's actions, especially considering our relationship rating of 3. Regan, you initially seemed to be on good terms with Sally, but now you're focusing on Lena. Is there something you're hiding?""""
Bryce: """"I'd like to say something. While Lena does have a point about Regan's change in behavior, I think we're jumping to conclusions about everyone. As for Regan and Sally's relationship, it's true they were close, but Regan also spoke up against Sally's vote to banish me. That suggests Regan wasn't blindly following Sally's lead. However, I do think we should examine our own actions and motives. I was the one who tried to gather information about everyone's alibis, and now that's being used against me. Perhaps we should be looking at ourselves, rather than each other, for potential clues about the killer's identity.""""

What would you like to say? 
Regan: """"I'd like to speak next. With Sally's death, I think we can all agree that she wasn't the killer. My main concern now is Lena, who initially seemed like an outsider but now seems to be playing a more active role in our discussions. I remember how Lena pointed out that she didn't have a clear alibi, and I think we should investigate that further. Additionally, Lena's vote to banish Bryce seemed suspicious, considering Bryce was trying to point out potential flaws in everyone's alibis. I'm not saying Lena is the killer, but I think we should keep a closer eye on her.""""
Lena: """"I agree with Regan that Lena's sudden involvement in discussions and her vote to banish Bryce does seem suspicious. However, I'd like to remind everyone that I was actually the one who pointed out Bryce's potential flaws in everyone's alibis. If anyone seems suspicious, I think we should also look at Regan's actions, especially considering our relationship rating of 3. Regan, you initially seemed to be on good terms with Sally, but now you're focusing on Lena. Is there something you're hiding?""""
Bryce: """"I'd like to say something. While Lena does have a point about Regan's change in behavior, I think we're jumping to conclusions about everyone. As for Regan and Sally's relationship, it's true they were close, but Regan also spoke up against Sally's vote to banish me. That suggests Regan wasn't blindly following Sally's lead. However, I do think we should examine our own actions and motives. I was the one who tried to gather information about everyone's alibis, and now that's being used against me. Perhaps we should be looking at ourselves, rather than each other, for potential clues about the killer's identity.""""

What would you like to say? 
Sally: ""I'd like to speak next. ""I've been keeping an eye on everyone's movements, and one thing that caught my attention is how Regan and I crossed paths in the Hallway and then again in the Bedroom. It seems like we were both trying to stay close to each other. I'm not saying Regan is the killer, but it's suspicious how we kept running into each other. I'm not pointing any fingers, but I think we should investigate further.""""
Regan: """"I understand what Sally is saying, but I think she's also forgetting that we're in the Kitchen now, and I didn't see her here until Lena joined us. Maybe we should also consider Lena's movements, since she appeared out of nowhere in the Kitchen. I didn't see her with anyone in the Hallway or Bedroom, which makes me wonder if she's been playing it too cool. I'm not accusing anyone, but I think we should keep an open mind and investigate everyone's alibis.""""
Lena: """"I'd like to speak next. I think we're all missing something here. I've been observing everyone's actions, and while Regan and Sally did cross paths, I noticed that I also crossed paths with Bryce in the Hallway twice, just like Regan and Sally did. My concern is not just about who we're interacting with, but also who we're not interacting with. I'm just as guilty as Lena of not having a clear alibi for my time in the Hallway. I think we should also investigate our individual alibis and consider the possibility that the killer might be someone who's been flying under the radar, avoiding interactions with the rest of us.""""
Bryce: """"I've been listening to all of your theories and concerns, and I think we're all jumping to conclusions. I'd like to speak up and point out that the person who has been the least mentioned so far is Sally. We all know that she was one of the first people to enter the Bathroom, and then she followed me and Regan into the Hallway. From there, she went into the Bedroom, where Tim was eventually found dead. Considering that she was one of the first to enter the Bathroom, she had a lot of time to plan and prepare, and she also had the opportunity to be alone with Tim in the Bedroom. I'm not accusing anyone, but I think we should also consider the possibility that the killer might be someone who had an advantage from the very beginning.""""

Given the earlier discussion about alibis and timelines, I think it's time for us to re-evaluate our assumptions and focus on Bryce's inconsistencies. I'm going to suggest that we take a closer look at his movements and see if we can find any discrepancies.""""

Lena was in the bedroom when she was killed, and I had just searched the closet. This could suggest that the killer might have been nearby, watching my actions or following me.

I'm not accusing anyone, but it's possible the killer was in the kitchen and left before I got there. I'm just throwing it out there.""""
Bryce: """"I think Regan's theory is a good one, and it's definitely worth considering. For me, it's a bit more personal. Since I've had a chance to interact with everyone, I have to say that I don't think Tim is capable of it, given our interactions so far. But, I also think it's possible that the killer is someone we've yet to interact with, or someone who's been lying in wait. We can't rule anyone out just yet, but I do think we should be looking for any potential motives or inconsistencies in people's stories.""""
Sally: """"I think Regan's theory is also a good starting point. From my perspective, I was alone in the bathroom initially, and then I moved to the hallway. I didn't see anyone suspicious around the bathroom, but now that you mention it, Regan, you were in the kitchen first. I think it's worth investigating further. I'd like to know if anyone has noticed anything unusual or out of place in the kitchen or the hallway.""""
Tim: """"I think it's a bit of a stretch to assume the killer was in the kitchen, but I do think it's a good point that we've only interacted with each other in the hallway. I'd like to point out that I was alone in the hallway for a bit, but that's where I met Regan. I think we should also consider the fact that the first person to be killed was Bob, and he was in the bedroom with both of us at the time. Could there be something more to that?""""

Regan: """"I'm shocked by Bryce's death, and I have to say that I'm not surprised that the killer is still among us. Given what we discussed earlier, I think it's still possible that the killer was in the kitchen initially. I didn't see anything out of place when I was searching the fridge, but now that Bryce is dead, I'm starting to wonder if Sally might have been in the kitchen before I was. We were alone together in the hallway, but that doesn't necessarily mean she couldn't have been in the kitchen earlier. I'm not accusing anyone, but I think we should re-examine our timelines and see if there's anything that stands out.""Based on your previous analysis of relationships, you had Sally as an 8, but now that she's a suspect, you might re-evaluate that to a 5.""
Sally: """"I understand Regan's concerns, but I think we're looking too far back into the timeline. I was searching the cabinets when Bryce walked into the kitchen, and then I saw Tim arrive a bit later. It's clear that Tim and Bryce interacted before Tim killed him. I'm starting to think that Tim might be our killer, especially since I saw the murder happen right before my eyes. I'm not saying it's conclusive evidence, but it's definitely a strong lead to investigate further.""""

What would you like to say? 
Bob: ""I'll keep quiet for now and listen to the others' theories.""
Bryce: """"I've been thinking, and I don't have any concrete evidence, but I find it a bit suspicious that Regan's death seems to have occurred right after I left the hallway. It's possible that whoever was following me, or whoever saw me moving, might have used that opportunity to act. I'm not saying it's one of the people I've been with, but I think it's worth considering whether someone might have been watching us from a distance.""""
Tim: """"I've also been thinking, and I noticed that Regan had been acting suspiciously in the kitchen earlier. I didn't think much of it at the time, but now that she's dead, it makes me wonder if she might have been onto something. I saw her searching the fridge, and I'm not sure what she was looking for, but it seemed important to her. Maybe we should take a closer look at what was in the fridge?""""
Sally: """"Hey everyone, I don't have any concrete evidence either, but I think it's worth considering that Regan's death might have something to do with the tension she had with the others. From what I remember, she had a pretty neutral relationship with all of us, but I recall her arguing with Bob and Tim earlier. I'm not saying they're guilty, but it's definitely something to consider. Let's also think about the fact that I saw Regan talking to... well, to someone in the hallway, but I didn't see who it was. Could be worth asking if anyone else saw anything?""""

Tim: """"I think we can rule Bob out as a suspect, given what I just witnessed in the kitchen. He's the one who killed Bryce, and now he's trying to downplay it. I think we should focus on the fact that he's been acting suspiciously from the start, and now we have evidence. I'm not sure what was in the fridge, but I think we should trust Regan's instincts and look into it, but more importantly, we need to keep an eye on Bob, because he's our prime suspect now.""""
Sally: """"I think Tim has a good point about Bob, and it's definitely suspicious that he's trying to downplay his actions now. However, I also think we should consider the fact that Tim's been acting pretty defensive since the start, and it's possible that he might be trying to shift the focus away from himself. I think we should take a closer look at the fridge and see if we can find any clues, but we should also keep an eye on both Bob and Tim, because it's possible that one of them might be hiding something.""""

As for my suspicions, I didn't see anything unusual last night, but I did notice that Tim was alone in the hallway earlier. It's possible that the killer could have taken advantage of that situation.

1. Tim
2. Lena

4. Sally
What would you like to say? 
Tim: """"I've been thinking about Regan's last actions before her death. She was with Bob in the bathroom and then with Lena in the kitchen. It's possible that she might have seen something suspicious in the hallway. But if I had to point a finger, I'd say it's worth investigating Lena further. She seemed to be in the kitchen with Regan around the time I saw her go there, and she's had interactions with Regan in the past. Just a thought.""""
Lena: """"I agree with Tim's point about Regan's last actions, but I think we should consider other factors too. I was in the kitchen with Regan when Tim saw her, but she didn't seem suspicious or scared. As for my past interactions with Regan, I had been trying to stay out of her way since our disagreement earlier, but I don't think that would be enough motive for me to harm her. I think we should also look into Sally's alibi, she was in the hallway when Regan and I were in the kitchen. She could've easily snuck into the kitchen while we were distracted.""""
Bob: """"I've been trying to piece together what happened, and I think we're all missing the bigger picture. I was in the bathroom with Regan, and then I went to the kitchen to get a drink. I didn't see anyone suspicious, but I did see Tim arguing with Regan earlier in the game. I think we should also consider the fact that the killer seems to be trying to create a pattern, always going back and forth between the bathroom and the hallway. I'm not saying it's a clear motive, but it's definitely something we should keep in mind when looking at the other players' actions. But I think we should give Sally a break for now, her alibi does seem solid.""""
Sally: """"I'd like to point out that I've been in the hallway a few times during this game, and Regan wasn't there at those times. It seems like the killer was always able to move around freely, without being seen. I think we should consider the possibility that the killer might have been trying to create a false alibi by being in the hallway with other players. However, I don't have any concrete evidence to back this up, so I think we should keep investigating and gathering more information.""""

What would you like to say? 
Bob: """"I've been thinking a lot about the pattern of the killer's movements and the votes that just occurred. I noticed that everyone voted to banish Lena, and now she's out of the house. It seems suspicious that the group would all agree on the same person, especially considering the fact that the killer was just able to kill Tim without being detected. I think it's possible that one of the remaining players, perhaps Sally, is trying to manipulate the group's perception of the killer. We should be cautious and not jump to conclusions based on a unanimous vote.""""
Sally: """"I think it's worth considering, but I don't think I'm the one manipulating the group. As for my suspicions, I didn't see anything unusual last night, but I did notice that Tim was alone in the hallway earlier. It's possible that the killer could have taken advantage of that situation. However, I think we should also look at Bob's behavior. He seemed pretty nervous when he went to the study, and now he's making a big deal about the group's vote. Maybe we should be watching him just as closely as we're watching each other.""""

What would you like to say? 
Bryce: """"I don't have any evidence against anyone, but I have to say I'm a bit suspicious of Tim. I found the key in the fridge, which suggests the killer might have been trying to mislead us, and Tim was the one who was in the hallway with me when I made my move to the kitchen.""""
Tim: """"I think we should consider the timeline and movements of everyone. I was in the hallway with Bryce, then went back to the bedroom, and finally returned to the hallway. Sally was in the bedroom with me initially, but I'm not sure where she was after I left. I don't think I saw her in the hallway until later. Maybe we should also think about Lena, since she's been quiet so far. Does anyone know where she was around the time Regan was killed?""""
Sally: """"I think we're focusing too much on the physical evidence and timelines, but we're forgetting about our own alibis. I was with Tim in the bedroom at the beginning, and then I went to the hallway. I remember seeing Regan and Lena there, but I didn't see anyone else. Considering my own movements, I think I can safely say I'm one of the last people Regan would have interacted with before she was killed. I'm not saying I'm the killer, but we should definitely consider the fact that I was in close proximity to Regan during that time.""""
Lena: ""As I listen to the discussion, I think it's essential to point out that I was the one who found the key in the fridge and used it to move to the hallway. Since I was alone in the kitchen initially, it suggests that the killer might have been trying to isolate themselves. Given the sequence of events and the fact that Regan was killed after I entered the hallway, it raises some questions about my presence there. I want to bring it up to make sure we consider my movements as well, especially since I was one of the first people to enter the hallway after Regan's death.""

Her vote to banish Tim seemed suspiciously convenient, and now that she's gone, it's clear that she was trying to take us off her own scent. I think we should look closer at her actions and statements from the beginning, and consider the fact that she was the one who found the key in the fridge and used it to move to the hallway.""""

However, I think we should also consider the fact that I was in the bedroom with Tim initially, and I'm one of the last people to have interacted with Regan before she was killed. I know I said earlier that I was considering my own movements, but I have to admit that I was trying to throw suspicion off myself as well. With Lena gone and Tim dead, I think it's safe to say that I'm the only one left who has a clear alibi for the time of the killings.

Tim: """"Actually, I think it's a little too obvious to point fingers at me. I've been trying to stay out of the way, observing everyone's behavior. I think Sally is the one who's been acting suspiciously calm. Maybe she's been playing it cool to throw us off her trail.""""
Lena: """"Actually, I've been paying attention to everyone's actions, and I have to agree with Tim. Sally did seem a bit too calm when we first found out about Bryce. But I also think it's worth considering Regan's behavior. She seemed to know exactly where to go when we found out the location of the crime scene. That's a pretty specific piece of information to remember.""""
Regan: """"I've been thinking, and I have to say I'm a bit surprised by your theories, Tim and Lena. I think it's interesting that you're pointing fingers at each other, but I'm not convinced either of you are the killer. As for me, I didn't know exactly where the crime scene was until we found out.

I didn't see Bryce with Regan either, but I did notice that Sally and I were in the hallway together, and then Sally went to the kitchen, while I went to the hallway and then to the bedroom, where I met Regan. I was alone in the bedroom when I searched the closet, so I had the opportunity to kill Regan, but I didn't find the key there. However, Bryce did interact with me in the kitchen earlier, and he was alone when he was there, which makes me wonder if he could have moved the key and then met up with Regan. I'm not accusing anyone yet, but I think we should also consider Bryce's actions.""""
Bryce: """"I think we're jumping to conclusions here. Just because I wasn't seen with Regan at the same time doesn't mean I didn't interact with her earlier. I did meet Regan in the hallway, and I also saw her in the kitchen with Sally. I think we should be looking at the timeline and locations more closely, rather than making assumptions about each other's actions.

Regan was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Lena
3. Bryce
What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"I'd like to say that, considering Regan's death, I have to consider everyone's actions. However, I noticed that I didn't see Bryce with Regan when I went to the kitchen and saw him there with me. Also, I saw Regan with Regan, Bryce, and you, Sally, in the hallway earlier, but then I didn't see you with Regan after that. My suspicion falls on you, Sally, as you were in the same location as Regan earlier.""""
Lena: """"Considering the timeline and locations, I have some suspicions as well. I didn't see Bryce with Regan either, but I did notice that Sally and I were in the hallway together, and then Sally went to the kitchen, while I went to the hallway and then to the bedroom, where I met Regan. I was alone in the bedroom when I searched the closet, so I had the opportunity to kill Regan, but I didn't find the key there. However, Bryce did interact with me in the kitchen earlier, and he was alone when he was there, which makes me wonder if he could have moved the key and then met up with Regan. I'm not accusing anyone yet, but I think we should also consider Bryce's actions.""""
Bryce: """"I think we're jumping to conclusions here. Just because I wasn't seen with Regan at the same time doesn't mean I didn't interact with her earlier. I did meet Regan in the hallway, and I also saw her in the kitchen with Sally. I think we should be looking at the timeline and locations more closely, rather than making assumptions about each other's actions. And let's not forget, I've been in the kitchen and the hallway alone at various points, so I had plenty of opportunities to kill Regan if I wanted to.""""

Bryce was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Regan
What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"Considering what happened, I have to say that my suspicions are now on Regan. I know we weren't close, but I've had a chance to interact with her, and she seemed suspiciously calm when we discussed potential killers earlier. She brought up her encounter with the person in the bathroom, but she didn't seem as invested in uncovering the truth as I was. Now that Bryce is dead, I think we should look more closely at Regan's alibi and see if she had any opportunity to kill Bryce in the bedroom or hallway.""""
Regan: """"I think we're jumping to conclusions. I was calm because I'm trying to stay focused on the game. My encounter with the person in the bathroom was a valid clue, and I was trying to share it with everyone. As for my alibi, I was in the hallway from Turn 8 to Turn 9. Anyone can vouch for my time there.""""

That means they had time to set up a trap, or they might have been watching us from the beginning. I don't think it's Regan or Sally, they seemed pretty shaken up when Lena died. As for Tim, he's always been a bit quiet, maybe too quiet. But my money's on Bryce, he's been acting suspiciously all game.""""
Sally: """"I don't think we should focus on individual players just yet. I think Regan's idea about the killer possibly being a setup or watching us from the beginning is a good point. I also noticed that Regan and Sally were indeed shaken up, but what about me? I was in the kitchen, and I know I saw Regan in the hallway after I left, but I didn't see her enter the bathroom. And Bryce was with me in the kitchen earlier, but then he left without telling us where he was going. Maybe we should be keeping an eye on Bryce's movements, but not jumping to conclusions just yet.""""
Tim: """"Actually, I think I can contribute something. I was in the hallway during the time Lena was in the bathroom. I didn't see or hear anyone else, but I did see Regan in the hallway later, like Sally mentioned. However, I also saw Bryce go into the bathroom a few minutes before I left the hallway to go to the bedroom, where I searched the pillow. I didn't think much of it at the time, but now it seems suspicious. We should definitely keep an eye on everyone's movements and see if we can gather more evidence before making any conclusions.""""
Bryce: """"I think it's interesting that we're all focusing on individual players, but what about the fact that I was in the kitchen the whole time? Sally and I were alone together, and we could have easily set up a trap without anyone noticing. I'm not saying I did it, but I think we should be looking at the group as a whole, rather than just pointing fingers at individual people. We should also consider the fact that Tim was searching the pillow in the bedroom, which might have been a distraction. I'm not saying anyone is guilty, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet and make sure we're considering all the possibilities.""""

But I do want to clarify that I was alone in the kitchen when Regan went back there earlier, but that doesn't mean I was planning something. I think we should focus on our individual alibis and see if we can piece together a timeline of events. Let's review what we were doing around the time Bryce was killed and see if anyone has a solid alibi.""""

What would you like to say? 
Lena: """"I'm shocked and devastated by the back-to-back murders. I have to say, Tim, your actions speak louder than words. First, you killed Bryce in the kitchen, and now Bob. It's not just a coincidence that both murders happened in the kitchen when you were alone with the victim. I think it's clear that you're our killer, and I'm not going to try to sugarcoat it. Your attempts to downplay the evidence and shift focus away from yourself are just making me more suspicious. I think it's time for you to face the music.""""
Tim: """"I'm shocked and disappointed by your accusations, Lena. I understand why you might think that, but I assure you, I'm not the killer. Just because I was in the kitchen with the victims doesn't mean I'm responsible. I'm a suspect, but I'm not the killer. I think we should focus on the timeline and see if there are any inconsistencies in our alibis. I was alone with Bryce, but that doesn't mean I killed him. Maybe we should take a closer look at your actions, Lena. You were in the hallway with Regan earlier, and now you're accusing me of being the killer. It's convenient that you're trying to deflect attention away from yourself. I think we need to keep an open mind and consider all possibilities, not just jump to conclusions based on limited information.""""

However, one thing that does stand out to me is that Sally was killed before we even had a chance to search the room thoroughly. I searched the closet twice, and I didn't find the key. It's possible that the killer might have used the closet to move around undetected. I'm not accusing anyone, but I think we should investigate the possibility of an outside person being involved.""""
Bryce: """"Regan, I agree that we should consider the possibility of an outside person. However, I think we also need to look at our own actions and alibis. I was in the hallway when it happened, but Tim was in the kitchen with Sally. He could have been the one who killed her, or at least, he could have been involved. I'm not accusing him, but we should definitely ask him some questions.""""
Tim: """"I think I can clear things up for everyone. I was in the kitchen, but I was by the counter, away from Sally. I didn't see anyone suspicious, but I did see Bryce walking towards the hallway around the time of the murder. I'm not accusing anyone, but I think it's worth asking Bryce where he was exactly during that time.""""
Bob: """"I think it's worth considering the fact that I was alone in the bathroom when I went to investigate after hearing the scream. I didn't see anyone else around, but I didn't check the closet or any other rooms thoroughly either. I did see Bryce in the hallway after I went back to the bathroom, so I didn't think much of it at the time. However, now that you mention it, Bryce was already in the hallway when I got there.

Tim: """"I think we're overthinking this. Regan, I think your point about my movements is fair, but I think I can explain that. I was trying to flush out the killer by acting like I was alone and being visible in the hallway. I thought that might make the killer more confident, and then we could catch them off guard. As for my actions, I was trying to be strategic and lead the killer to a more isolated area. I think I might have actually worked in my favor, though, because now the killer is focused on me. But, Regan, I want to bring up something that I think is suspicious - Regan's repeated trips to the kitchen, especially now that we know the killer was in the kitchen.

It makes me wonder if they were waiting for me, or if they were trying to make it look like I had something to do with it. I'm not saying it's me, but I did go back to the hallway after checking the bedroom. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I think we should keep an eye on each other and see if anyone else makes any suspicious moves.""""
Sally: """"Considering the sequence of events and the fact that Lena was killed in the hallway after I left it, I have to say that I'm suspicious of Regan's timing. We had passed each other in the hallway multiple times, and I remember going back to the kitchen after we crossed paths.

What would you like to say? 
Tim: """"I've noticed that both Lena and Bob went to the bathroom multiple times, but whenever the killer went to the bathroom, they immediately returned to the hallway or switched locations. This pattern makes me think the killer might be someone who wants to avoid being caught while also having easy access to other areas of the house.""""
Bob: """"Hey everyone, I've been thinking about the fact that the killer seemed to take Lena out in the hallway, right after I went back there. It makes me wonder if they were waiting for me, or if they were trying to make it look like I had something to do with it. I'm not saying it's me, but I did go back to the hallway after checking the bedroom. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I think we should keep an eye on each other and see if anyone else makes any suspicious moves.""""
Sally: """"Considering the sequence of events and the fact that Lena was killed in the hallway after I left it, I have to say that I'm suspicious of Regan's timing. We had passed each other in the hallway multiple times, and I remember going back to the kitchen after we crossed paths. If Regan was indeed the killer, they seemed to have made an effort to keep a low profile, but the coincidence of us being in the hallway at the same time does raise some red flags for me.""""

I remember Regan was indeed the last one to enter the bathroom, but I also recall her arguing with Tim earlier that night.

However, I also want to consider the fact that I saw her entering the bathroom right after me, and I was only in there for a brief moment. It's possible she was just looking for Tim, not to harm him. That being said, I do think we should question her further. Maybe we can get to the bottom of this by asking her about the argument and her alibi for the time Tim was killed.""""
Regan: """"I'm shocked and appalled by these accusations. I understand that the argument with Tim was intense, but it was nothing more than a disagreement over a game we were playing. As for my alibi, I was in the hallway for a brief moment, looking for Sally. I was waiting for her to finish getting ready so we could leave together.

With the current evidence, I believe Bryce is the most suspicious person, and I'd like to discuss his alibi for the time Tim was killed.""""
Bryce: """"I'm shocked by Tim's death as well, but I think Regan is misinterpreting the evidence. Just because I was with Sally in the Bedroom and the killer was in the Bedroom, it doesn't mean I'm the killer. And as for my alibi, I was with Sally when she was killed, and I have no idea what Regan is talking about in terms of a pattern.

Sally: """"Lena, I'm so sorry to hear about Regan's death. Considering our previous conversation, I don't think you had a motive to kill Regan. In fact, you seemed to be trying to clear her name. As for me, I've been stuck in the bathroom trying to find the key. My relationship with you has been quite friendly, so I'm inclined to trust you. However, I do think we should investigate further, especially since Bob's banishment might have been a ruse to distract us. I propose we search the kitchen and living room to see if we can find any clues about Regan's murder.""""
Lena: """"""I appreciate your kind words, Sally. I want to assure you that I had nothing to do with Regan's death. As we discussed earlier, I was trying to defend her and clear her name. However, I do have to bring up a point that might seem suspicious. You've been stuck in the bathroom looking for the key, and now Regan is dead. That means you've had ample opportunity to kill her, but we didn't think to suspect you because you were in the bathroom. I'm not saying you're the killer, but I do think we should be cautious and not rule out any possibilities. Let's focus on searching the kitchen and living room, but we should also consider that the killer might be trying to mislead us with false clues and distractions. We need to stay vigilant and think carefully about our next steps.""""""

Regan: """"I went to the sink in the bathroom and searched it, but I didn't find the key.
