Bob: """"I've been thinking, and I didn't find anything incriminating in the kitchen. However, I did find a key in the fridge, which makes me wonder if our killer was trying to hide something or lead us away from a more important clue. Maybe we should focus on other areas of the house and see if we can find anything related to Lena's death.""""
Regan: """"I'm not sure about the key, Bob, but I think we should consider our alibis and see if anyone noticed anything suspicious. I was alone in the bathroom when Lena was killed, and I'm not sure if anyone else saw me going to the hallway and then to the bedroom. I don't think I had time to do anything to her, but it's worth discussing.""""
Tim: """"I think we're looking at this from the wrong angle. We're focusing on alibis and physical clues, but what if the killer was more about psychology? I was alone in the hallway when I saw you all, and I didn't see anyone else around. It makes me wonder if the killer was watching us, studying our movements, and choosing the perfect moment to strike. We should consider if anyone noticed anything unusual about Lena's behavior before she died, or if there was anything that stood out about her actions that could give us a lead.""""
Sally: """"Guys, let's not jump to conclusions. I think we're all thinking about this the wrong way. We're all trying to figure out who the killer is, but I think we should be thinking about why someone would target Lena. We didn't know her well, but I do recall her being a bit... standoffish towards all of us. I remember her saying some harsh things to each of us, and now she's dead. Maybe the killer wasn't targeting us specifically, but rather someone who wronged them. I'm not saying I'm the killer, but I am saying that we should consider Lena's behavior and interactions with each of us before making any accusations.""""

Tim was killed! Now the group will have a discussion about who they think the killer is. Try to be brief and tell about your suspicions. Reminder - these are active players: 
1. Sally
2. Bob
3. Bryce
4. Lena
What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"Bryce seems too obvious, I'm not going to point fingers, but let's be real, we all have motives and past conflicts. I think it's one of the people who's been neutral or on the fence this whole time.""""
Bob: """"Based on what I've seen so far, I have to say my suspicions lean towards Sally. I know it sounds weird since she's been talking like she doesn't suspect anyone, but seeing her kill Tim in the hallway changes everything for me. It seems like she's been playing us all along, and her words now are just trying to throw us off her scent.""""
Bryce: ""I'd like to speak up, ""I understand the concerns everyone has, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Based on what I've seen, Sally and Bob are acting suspiciously, but I think we should also consider the fact that Lena has been rather quiet throughout this investigation. I've interacted with her the least, so I don't have much to go on, but her lack of input raises some red flags for me. We should keep an open mind and gather more information before pointing fingers.""""
Lena: """"I'd like to share my thoughts as well. Initially, I thought Bryce was a strong suspect, but Sally's words did give me some pause. I don't think it's fair to dismiss him without concrete evidence. As for Bob, his sudden change of heart after seeing Sally kill Tim does seem suspicious. But, I agree with Bryce that we should also consider Lena's lack of involvement. However, I'd like to point out that she's been acting pretty neutral the whole time, which might be a sign of innocence rather than guilt. Let's keep our eyes on everyone and not jump to conclusions just yet.""""

What would you like to say? 
Sally: """"""I'm shocked that Bob's gone. To be honest, I was starting to think that maybe he was involved, but now that he's out of the picture, I'm not so sure. I still think Bryce is a strong suspect, but I also think we should look into Lena's quiet demeanor. She's been acting pretty neutral, but maybe that's just what the killer is doing to throw us off their scent. I'm not pointing fingers, but I think we should consider Lena's lack of involvement and see if we can find any clues that might indicate her involvement.""""
Bryce: """"I've been thinking, and I have to say, Sally's words now are suspiciously innocent. Given her past behavior and her current words, I'm starting to think she's our killer. She's been trying to manipulate us and play us against each other, and now that Bob's gone, she's trying to shift the attention away from herself. I think we should take a closer look at her and see if we can find any evidence that might link her to the murders.""""
Lena: """"Actually, I think we're jumping to conclusions here. We don't know much about each other's past behavior, and it's easy to misinterpret innocent actions. I was trying to stay neutral and not draw attention to myself, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm the killer. Can we focus on actual clues and facts instead of assumptions? We need to work together to figure out what really happened.""""

What would you like to say? 
Sally: ""Sally's already spoken her mind earlier, so I'll focus on Lena. I'd say, ""I think Lena's been playing it too safe. She's been trying to avoid attention, which makes her seem suspiciously innocent. I think she might be the killer, and I'm surprised we didn't banish her earlier. We should keep a close eye on her and look for any clues that might link her to the murders.""""
Lena: ""I'd say, ""I understand why you're suspicious, Sally, but I think you're jumping to conclusions again. Just because I tried to stay neutral doesn't mean I'm the killer. I think we should focus on actual evidence and not rely on assumptions. We should also consider the fact that we didn't banish each other earlier, which suggests that we're not the main suspects. I think we should work together to investigate and find the real killer.""""
